</h2>

<p>Mr. Dalken’s southern cruise had come to an
end, much to Polly’s and Eleanor’s regret.
Though there had been discomforts and many unlooked
for incidents throughout the voyage to the
West Indies, and to both coasts of South America,
the entire yachting party had thoroughly enjoyed
the long pleasure trip.</p>

<p>Now they were back in prosaic, old New York,
with its eternal clatter and bang of hustling affairs,
and the crush and rush of the mobs of
strangers or the workers at recess hours; but
they seemed to be tense and nervous at such
metropolitan confusion. Mr. Dalken laughed,
as he escorted his party from the <i>White Crest</i>,
upon its arrival at the dock of the Yacht Club—every
one seemed irritable and displeased with
the city.</p>

<p>“What an awful din!” exclaimed Eleanor, closing
her ears with her forefingers.</p>

<p>“I only wish we were back in Buenos Aires—they
never make such a deafening racket there,”
added Jack, frowning, as a pushcart owner
bawled his wares directly back of the young
dandy’s ear.</p>

<p>Jack’s friends laughed appreciatively at the
foreigner’s timely shout, and Jack scowled at the
unconscious offender. Then, as if to provide still
more amusement for the members of the party,—excepting
Jack, of course,—the Italian tried to
avoid a mud-puddle in the asphalt, just as the
young New Yorker sprang lightly over it. The
result was Jack collided with the rickety cart,
which was filled with over-ripe bananas and
lemons.</p>

<p>The unexpected blow from the corner of the
cart sent Jack sprawling upon the street, and the
pyramid of fruit descended instantaneously upon
him, then bounced in every direction, giving the
ever-present street urchins an unusual treat.</p>

<p>Eleanor, the irrepressible, began to sing: “Yes,
we have no bananas,” but this ridiculous ditty
failed to calm Jack’s annoyance. The laughter
from not only his friends, but from every one who
had witnessed the funny episode, made him turn
upon the outraged vendor.</p>

<p>“What do you mean, by running me down like
that?” demanded Jack, glaring at the still petrified
foreigner. As though this demand loosed the
pent-up torrent of the man’s grief, he deluged the
cosmos with his heart-wrung lamentations. Mr.
Dalken and Mrs. Courtney understood Italian,
and they could sympathize with the poor man,
whose tale of woe might have melted a stone
image. Even Jack could not cope with the volubility
of the peddler.</p>

<p>Finally, Mr. Dalken stepped over and took out
his wallet. Instantly, the bereaved man’s face
changed its expression, and his voice died down
to a murmur of anticipation.</p>

<p>“Here’s a ten dollar bill, my man. See to it
that your eleven children, now dependent upon
your fruit-sales, are comfortably fed to-day. You
say they have had nothing to eat for three days—not
even such bad fruit as you have on sale—so
I am sending this to them.” As he handed the
money to the vendor, the Italian broke forth
in a new strain—one of heaping blessings upon
the great monseigneur, the bounteous gentleman!</p>

<p>“I just know he will pick up every lemon and
black banana he can find the moment we are out
of sight!” declared Nancy Fabian, smiling as she
touched upon the truth.</p>

<p>“<i>I</i> wouldn’t have been so easy, Dalky,” grumbled
Jack, trying to remove some of the dirt from
his coat.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t spending my money, Jack—don’t
worry over that! I thought, seeing that you
caused the trouble, that I would apply a part of
your quarterly income to assuage the misery of
the father of eleven little New Americans,” explained
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>The blank look of disgust upon Jack’s face
brought forth another ripple of laughter at his
expense.</p>

<p>Thus teasing the young man in the party, and
laughing or talking eagerly of everything they
saw, the four girls followed their elders to the
subway station.</p>

<p>But I anticipate: perhaps you are not acquainted
with these happy young friends, who just
came from the beautiful private yacht, the <i>White
Crest</i>! In order to introduce you, before the
girls proceed to Mr. Dalken’s apartment where
they were to have luncheon that day, I will leave
them for a short time during their ride on the
subway.</p>

<p>Polly Brewster, the favorite in Mr. Dalken’s
group of young friends, had been born and raised
in Colorado. Her home, a great ranch located
in the crater of an extinct volcano known upon
the map as “The Devil’s Grave,” had been renamed
by Rancher Brewster, “Pebbly Pit,” because
of the marvelous Rainbow Cliffs which
formed one of the boundary walls of the crater.
These cliffs were composed of great masses of
colored stones, which were readily broken from
the towering wall. All about the foot of the cliffs
were scattered tons of these shining pebbles. At
the back of the wall ran the queer formations of
lava which took grotesque forms, such as statues
of men and animals. This undulating stretch of
hardened lava became known to the surrounding
ranchers as “The Imps” and the “Devil’s Causeway.”</p>

<p>Since Polly had left her western home to study
a course of interior decorating in New York City,
the Rainbow Cliffs and the mass of hardened lava
which extended far back of the colored, pebbly
wall had been transformed by modern machinery
set up on the grounds, to cut the lava-jewels
into marketable gems. This work, started after
the group of wide-awake financiers headed by Mr.
Dalken had seen the great possibilities in the
stones, now provided most of the income by which
Polly, as well as some of her friends, found it
possible to travel luxuriously wherever inclination
invited them.</p>

<p>This powerful company might never have been
formed, had not circumstances developed from
that first meeting of Eleanor Maynard and Polly
Brewster, at the Colorado ranch where Eleanor
went to spend the summer. But, then, you must
read that story called “Polly of Pebbly Pit,” if
you would know how Anne Stewart, the teacher,
took Eleanor and her sister Barbara out of their
society atmosphere in Chicago, and suddenly
transported them to the simple but wholesome
life of a ranch. And then, how Polly took her
new friends for a trip to Grizzly Slide, where
they encountered the terrific blizzard which was
instrumental in leading them willy-nilly into a
gold-mine.</p>

<p>The gold-mine, so thrillingly discovered, eventually
founded the beginning of Polly and Eleanor’s
introduction to the world—a world of New
York adventures, European travels, business experiences, and touring or cruising with their millionaire,
self-appointed guardian, “Dalky,” in
company with other chosen friends.</p>

<p>The last tour Mr. Dalken had planned and carried
out very successfully was the Southern Cruise,
with the Fabians, the Ashbys, John Baxter,—always
called “Jack”—and the two girls, Polly and
Eleanor, with their intimate friend and chaperon,
Mrs. Courtney. Nancy Fabian and Ruth
Ashby had been members of Polly and Eleanor’s
party in Europe, hence they seemed very much
like girls in one family—so intimately acquainted
had they all become with each other.</p>

<p>We left Polly and her circle of friends on
board the <i>White Crest</i>, just after it had resumed
its homeward voyage from Cayenne, and now, in
this present book of adventures, we meet the girls
after landing in New York City. They may have
been glad to get home, to replenish a limited
wardrobe such as they had been advised to take
on board the yacht, when she sailed from New
York for the South American tour; but they also
felt poignant regret at having to say good-by to
the good times they had had.</p>

<p>Consequently, the four girls, to say nothing of
Jack, sat about Mr. Dalken’s large dining-table,
after their elders had left the room to discuss
politics and current events of New York City.
They were wondering whether Dalky would feel
disposed to invite them again on board his yacht,
should he return to Colombia, in company with
Mr. Fuzzier, to inspect the plans of the great
railroad and canal system which the group of
financiers had developed during their voyage between
Cayenne and New York.</p>

<p>“Well, now, girls,” ventured Jack Baxter, “I’ll
promise you this much—if Dalky will consent to
my sharing an interest in this new project of his,
I will move heaven and earth to include you in
the prospecting party. But there must be no frills
or furbelows, understand? In fact, I’m sure
you’ll have to travel minus cold cream and beauty
make-up, on such a tramp to the interior—it will
mean riding-breeches and such, to facilitate progress
through the Amazon jungle, no doubt.”</p>

<p>Since no one took Jack seriously, the girls now
laughed at his grave expression and businesslike
tone. It was not compatible with their knowledge
of Jack, to believe him in earnest about this new
mining scheme of the group of capitalists—a
scheme that meant hard work and many sacrifices
of luxuries and comforts. Jack had never been
known to give up his lazy self-indulgences, hence
the girls’ laughter.</p>

<p>A short time after the older members in the
party had left the luncheon table, Mr. Dalken
returned with a great sheaf of letters in his hand.
In the other hand he held an open sheet of paper,
which he had been reading just before entering
the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Well, children, here’s news, all right! I had
my mail for the past week held here to await my
return to the city; and now, with other letters
which had not been forwarded since we left Cayenne,
I find a letter from Ebeneezer Alexander—Dodo’s
father, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes!” was the chorus to this announcement,
and the four girls, as well as Jack, expressed
eager interest in the contents of the letter.</p>

<p>“He writes me a few personal bits of information
regarding certain mining interests we have in
common in Arizona, and then he goes on to report
favorably on the gold mine at Choko’s Find.
He seems to have solved the problem of getting
at the vein without starting a landslide every time
one winks at the peak. He is enthusiastic and
tremendously interested in the possible outcome
of his investigations and makes expert miner’s
suggestions to John Brewster and Tom Latimer.
If the tests he now has under way, prove to be
reliable experiments, our troubles over the Lost
Claim may be buried and forgotten. That leaves
us free for new troubles.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken smiled as he explained this much
of the letter, and, finding his audience about to
storm him with questions, he held up a hand for
silence, and anticipated some of the queries about
to be made.</p>

<p>“I know—you all want to know about Dodo!
Is she with her Dad at the ranch in Colorado? or
is she home with her mother? Is she as enthusiastic
over interior decorating as ever—or has she
deserted the ranks, for a beau? Is she willing to
join an expedition to the North Pole, or will she
prefer to spend her millions in eating bon bons
and growing obese like her mother? All of which
I cannot answer, but which you girls may have
the opportunity to ask personally very soon, provided
you can be induced to turn your backs upon
New York’s charm, and give your enlivening company
to a sear, old man like me.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Dalky?” demanded
Nancy Fabian.</p>

<p>“Is this an invitation to go somewhere?” asked
Ruth Ashby.</p>

<p>“Dalky—are we off for another adventure?”
exclaimed Eleanor Maynard, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Oh! Dalky is going west to inspect the mines,
and he wants us to go with him!” declared Polly,
clasping her hands, anxiously.</p>

<p>Jack said nothing, because he knew he would
learn sooner by keeping quiet. And he was right
in his surmise.</p>

<p>“Polly comes nearer the truth than you realize;
but I’m sure she has Choko’s Find and the Rainbow
Cliffs in mind, when she refers to the
‘mines’; but I have the mines of Southern Arizona
mentioned here in this letter—and those are
the ones I will have to visit without loss of time.
In fact, I should have joined Alexander more
than three weeks before this, but I failed to receive
his cable which was sent to Rio de Janeiro.
Possibly we had just left there before it arrived.
Now, however, there is no excuse for my dallying
in New York when tremendous interests depend
upon my personal visit to certain holdings
out west. You all know of the plans on foot, to
incorporate a land company to exploit and open
up the interior of the northern section of South
America, and as stock-holders in that company
organized on board the <i>White Crest</i>, you appreciate
the necessity of unlimited capital. Mr. Alexander’s
letter offers me a remarkable method of
securing necessary funds for the work that Mr.
Fuzzier and I hope to launch very shortly. Hence,
my haste in saying farewell to New York again,
and taking my little kit-bag and starting west.
How I should long to have agreeable company
with me—provided such friends could be prevailed
upon to pass up a shopping season in New
York. I shall bear no grudge against the attractive
shops, however, should my feminine contingent
decide in favor of new styles and ravishing
gewgaws.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dalky!” rebuked Nancy Fabian.</p>

<p>“You know better than that, Dalky!” remonstrated
Ruth.</p>

<p>“I’m ready to start west on the Twentieth Century—leaves
at two-twenty,” declared Eleanor,
positively, causing all to laugh at her.</p>

<p>“How fortunate, Dalky, that your plans fit in
so nicely with my own,” remarked Polly, a twinkle
in her eyes. “I am about to go home to visit
my family, and to judge for myself how the
climate of Arizona agrees with Dodo.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken laughed outright. Then Jack
cleared his throat and murmured: “Yes; Polly
was speaking to me confidentially, not two minutes
before you joined us, of the pleasure it would give
her if I would use my persuasive powers in inducing
you to consider our invitation to visit Pebbly
Pit.”</p>

<p>The stares from the girls made Mr. Dalken
laugh again, but he hastened to reply to his ward’s
invitation. “Fine, Jack! I always try to save a dollar,
in order to have the more to spend upon other
things; now I shall gladly avail myself of this
agreeable and convenient invitation, thereby saving
all the expense of a western journey. But you
do not say how far nor how long this invitation
is to last me. Am I to infer that you propose
paying all my expenses throughout the western
trip?”</p>

<p>Jack was equal to his guardian’s question.
“The invitation we had in mind to extend to you
is for a visit to Pebbly Pit. Nothing was said
about expenses of getting there, or of getting
back again. It is immaterial to the host and
hostess how their guests arrive—by air, rail or
afoot. Therefore I would advise you to take
enough carfare to insure you a seat in a train, in
case your cross-country walking grows too fatiguing.”</p>

<p>The girls now laughed in their turn, and Mr.
Dalken added: “Who will pay your fare—you
have overdrawn your quarterly account, you
know, by running down that poor fruit peddler.”</p>

<p>“I have a plan which will provide for all my
needs during the next few months, and render the
greatest service to a friend, at the same time,”
was Jack’s surprising news.</p>

<p>“Indeed! May I ask what that plan is?” asked
his guardian.</p>

<p>“You may, since you are the friend I hope to
serve.”</p>

<p>“I may be the friend, but I doubt whether your
services are very helpful to me—I judge entirely
by past services, understand?” retorted Mr. Dalken,
gazing quizzically at the young man.</p>

<p>Jack tilted back in his chair, and thrust his
hand down into his trousers pockets; then he
glanced impishly up at his guardian. “Why, I’ve
discovered how necessary a valet is to your comfort
and decent appearance in public, and I have
applied for and accepted the position as valet to
your respected self. That engagement includes
all traveling expenses of mine, and leaves you
ample time and leisure to enjoy your journey with
these young ladies. It is an ideal combination.”</p>

<p>Jack’s plans, inspired upon the moment’s demand,
provided fun and laughter for some time
thereafter. Mr. Dalken had to sit down, he
laughed so heartily at the very idea of his ward
doing any kind of service for another. But Polly,
by her remark, put Jack on his mettle.</p>

<p>“If I were Dalky, I’d make you live up to that
agreement—there are four witnesses to what was
said, and you ought to prove what stuff is in you,
then you can win Dalky’s consent to your going
to South America with our other boys, when Mr.
Fuzzier is ready to launch his land-operations.”</p>

<p>“Of course I meant what I just said, Dalky,”
insisted Jack. And to his utter amazement his
guardian took him at his word.</p>

<p>“Done, Jack! You go west with me, to attend
to my wants and to receive for your valet services
all expenses and a hundred dollars a month.
For that, I shall expect you to look after my comforts,
the traveling accommodations, hotel suites,
autos, and what-not. You may have every other
Sunday off for yourself, and an evening once a
week. All your other time belongs to me—not
even a chance for a little flirtation with a pretty
girl on the train, or out on the deserts of Arizona.”</p>

<p>“And how about the girls you take with you—any
chance for Jack to say a word to them, now
or then?” laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“That depends! If such words do not conflict
with my own, I may overlook the unusual behavior
on the part of a valet.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney now entered the room, and
wanted to know what could be so absorbing that
no one at the table had heard the summons from
those in the living-room. Before she could quite
conclude her questioning, an avalanche of explanations
overwhelmed her. In the confusion
of voices, she could not get the drift of what it
meant, so Mr. Dalken led her back to the other
room and there he explained to his friends what
he had told the girls—and he added, he had secured
five companions for his western journey.
It would develop, as soon as he had outlined his
trip, how many more wished to accompany him.</p>

<p>In another moment, he was the center of interest,
and all was hushed in anticipation of what
was about to be revealed.</p>

</h2>

<p>In spite of persuasions, threats, and prophecies
of good times to be missed, the Ashbys and Fabians
could not be induced to join the proposed
party to the Southwest. Mr. Ashby declared that
he would have to attend strictly to business after
his long vacation, or Polly and Eleanor would
have the opportunity for which they said they
were waiting—the chance to succeed Mr. Ashby
in his enviable shops. Naturally, learning that
her husband would not think of leaving the city,
Mrs. Ashby was firm in the decision to remain
home, too. Ruth did not wish to leave her
mother, so that eliminated the three Ashbys from
Mr. Dalken’s list.</p>

<p>The Fabians were not to be cajoled into going
west with the rest of their friends, because they
maintained that New York, being their home,
was the place for them to recuperate after the
delightful though lazy life on board the yacht.
Mr. Fabian said that laziness was a disease which
must be cured by hard work for a time, if his
family hoped to live during the approaching winter.
Nancy found keen enjoyment in being with
her old friends again, and so she preferred to remain
in the city.</p>

<p>Consequently Mr. Dalken’s party consisted of
Polly and Eleanor, with Mrs. Courtney as chaperon,
and Jack Baxter. Mr. Dalken, of course,
since he was the prime leader on this tour. Where
they would eventually find themselves, no one
knew, because that had not yet been revealed to
any one.</p>

<p>“All we now know is this,” laughed Mr. Dalken,
the last night the friends met at his apartment
to bid the travelers good-by, “that we
are on our way, and that way may criss-cross
the country many times before we reach California.”</p>

<p>“But you promised us that we should see California,
Dalky, because there is where we are
dying to go,” exclaimed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“California is a great state, my child,” declared
Jack, paternally; “and Hollywood is but one
small section of it. I should not blame poor
Dalky, in the least, if he led you three aspirants
for the screen <i>away</i> from Hollywood, instead of
<i>to</i> it.”</p>

<p>This was in the light of a revelation. “Ah!”
laughed Mr. Dalken, “now I understand why this
intense eagerness to visit California for an extended
time. But let me warn you, fair ones—I
shall see to it that I am not deprived of my traveling
companions just at the time I shall have leisure
to enjoy their society. Forewarned is forearmed,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” retorted Polly, “that adage is as good
for us as for you, Dalky.”</p>

<p>“Besides,” added Mrs. Courtney, shaking an
accusing finger at Jack, “it was that valet’s own
proposition that we remain in Hollywood long
enough to have a fling at a movie! He thinks his
handsome person may find fame and fortune in
posing before the cameras.”</p>

<p>The laugh now turned upon Jack, and he had
no denial ready. Thus, laughing and joking, the
little group passed a merry evening, until the
Ashbys said it was time to say good-by and start
for home. Soon Mr. Dalken was left alone with
Jack to complete the last few items of their packing.</p>

<p>The following day found all baggage on the
way west, and Mr. Dalken, with his party, on
board the Chicago Express, leaving New York
behind. When the forms upon the platform became
a blurred spot, Polly and Eleanor returned
from the observation platform and sat down with
their friends, Mr. Dalken, Mrs. Courtney and
Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are,” declared Eleanor, “not a
month since we landed in the city, and off again
for another jaunt.”</p>

<p>“I only hope this trip will prove to be as enlightening
to you young ladies as the last one
must have been,” Jack replied.</p>

<p>“Enlightening! I do not understand you,”
said Polly.</p>

<p>“Oh, geographically, I mean! You must admit,
girls, that your ideas of South America were
completely reversed. Did you dream of finding
such transportation systems as we enjoyed—from
Lake Titicaca to La Paz, for instance? And then
to behold such vast tracts of nerve tonic as Nolla
found up in the nitrate fields.”</p>

<p>The merry laugh which followed this remembrance,—now
a funny experience of the past, but
once a most painful incident of traveler’s luck—launched
memory in reviewing other laughable
episodes, and many a smile and giggle drew the
attention of other passengers in the Pullman to
the happy group.</p>

<p>After a delicious dinner in the dining-car, Mr.
Dalken led his protégés back to their compartments
once more. Then he showed them the
sketch of a map he had made before deciding
finally on this journey.</p>

<p>“You can see by this map that we propose to
stay in Chicago for a few days, while I interview
Fuzzier and his capitalists about the Land Development
Company. During those few days
Eleanor will have an opportunity to visit her
home and family, and the others may visit the
Public Library and ascertain where the richest
veins of ore can be found in Arizona. It may
prove advantageous, in case you decide to stake
claims which the United Verde Company overlooked.”
Mr. Dalken traced the pencil-line upon
the paper, from Chicago to Flagstaff, Arizona,
and then showed his audience where the Verde
was to be found.</p>

<p>“But, Dalky, you do not propose to go straight
to Arizona, after leaving Chicago, do you?”
asked Polly, wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Not unless you have good reasons to avoid
going to Pebbly Pit,” returned he, trying to control
a smile, as he thought of Tom Latimer
eagerly awaiting Polly’s arrival.</p>

<p>Polly frowned. “The main reason of wanting
to visit home was the longing to see mother and
father, and John and Anne.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I see,” teased Jack. “Sary and
Jeb have no part in your life, and the star-boarder
at Pebbly Pit has been forgotten, eh?” By “star-boarder,”
Jack referred to Tom, who, with John,
had remained on the premises to guard and superintend
the mines and their output.</p>

<p>Polly flushed angrily, and Mrs. Courtney,
thinking that the teasing was becoming too personal,
quickly changed the subject, by saying:
“Time to retire, I see. The porter wants to make
up the berths.”</p>

<p>Every individual in their party had been flying
around during the past few days, and now that
all necessity for haste and hurry was over they
felt the reaction. Hence, Mrs. Courtney’s suggestion
to retire was hailed without protest.
There may have been those on that train that
passed a sleepless night, but not so with any one
in the Dalken group.</p>

<p>The next morning they realized that Chicago
was nearer than they had thought possible, because
so much time had been given to sleep. So,
when Jack laughingly played the part of valet
and gathered up the bags in order to hand them
to the colored porter, the girls gazed from the
windows to assure themselves that they were
really pulling in at the Chicago terminal.</p>

<p>Mr. Maynard had been wired that his daughter
and others in her party were to arrive in Chicago
on the noon train, and the moment they
stepped from the car, he was seen to be awaiting
them. In another moment, Eleanor was being
smothered against a broad, fatherly breast, and
the other friends were smiling sympathetically at
Mr. Maynard’s joy.</p>

<p>“Well, well, well! Where is my little tom-boy?
I here behold a tall, up-to-date young
woman, whom I almost dread to hug,” exclaimed
Mr. Maynard, holding Eleanor off at arm’s
length.</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind!” retorted Eleanor, making
a dive and throwing both arms about her
father’s neck. “If you have any compunction
about hugging in public, your daughter hasn’t!”</p>

<p>“I can verify that, Mr. Maynard,” added Mr.
Dalken, smiling, to hide his own feelings as he
thought of his daughter, Elizabeth, and her
habitual aversion to him and his affection. “We
find it very embarrassing, at times, to control
Nolla’s desire to hang about our dignified necks.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” was all the answer vouchsafed him.
But Mr. Maynard laughed happily—he would
have laughed at any silly thing, so glad was he to
have his pet with him again.</p>

<p>The days in Chicago passed swiftly by for
those who were to continue on their way to Pebbly
Pit. Mr. Maynard gave every moment of
his time to his guests,—they had been induced to
accept his hospitality, instead of going to a hotel,—and
Mr. Dalken found ample time in which to
discuss finance with Mr. Fuzzier and the select
group of bankers he had interested in his plans
to develop the interior of Colombia. Mr. Maynard
had already heard the inside information of
the scheme, and he had signed up to join the
speculators in this vast undertaking.</p>

<p>Finally came the day when Eleanor said good-by
to her parents and friends again, and the
eager members of Mr. Dalken’s party started on
their way to Pebbly Pit.</p>

<p>How familiar seemed the prairie lands to
Polly, as the train steamed across the vast plains,
and began to approach Denver! Then came a
hasty change from the Chicago Express to the
local for Oak Creek, and at last the travelers
were on the final ride of that journey to Polly’s
ranch-home.</p>

<p>More than a year had passed since Polly had
visited the mining settlement, where the train
stopped to accommodate passengers for and from
the surrounding country-side. And in that year
great progress had been made in the growth and
improvement of the place. Polly was astonished
to see the mushroomlike rapidity with which the
two-story houses had replaced the shacks of the
old town; and now streets were laid out and
lighted for the convenience of towns-folk, as well
as for the ranchers.</p>

<p>The Brewsters had come in full force to welcome
the expected friends, and joyous were the
shouts of the young people, when all were gathered
upon the railway platform. In fact, so
eager seemed every one in that circle that no one
paid heed to what the others said—but each one
laughed and talked effusively without regard to
subject.</p>

<p>Two huge ranch-wagons had been requisitioned
to hold the happy individuals now about to
drive to Pebbly Pit; nor did any one notice the
rough trail, nor the long trip, before the first
glimpse of Rainbow Cliffs came to view.</p>

<p>Here Polly found the greatest change in her
old environment: the great grinding mill, the
shafts which worked the apparatus used in moving
the tons of stones to the mills, and the small
railroad train and tiny engine which transported
the rough jewels to the packinghouse. And all
this activity was well hidden from the sight, by
the natural depression of the Devil’s Causeway,
with the peaks called “The Imps” standing in
front like a screen.</p>

<p>Polly seemed genuinely glad to see Tom Latimer
again, and Tom’s heart leaped high when he
realized that his beloved seemed inclined to treat
him kindly once more.</p>

<p>Tom had been taking lessons of Anne, since
his farewell to Polly at Palm Beach—now seemingly
such a long time ago! And it promised a
relieved frame of mind for Polly, if Tom would
but adhere to Anne’s repeated advices and instructions
to him. That remained to be seen!</p>

<div id='002' class='mt10 mb10 w002'>
  <img src='images/illus-002.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>SARY CAME BOUNDING OUT TO MEET THEM.</p>
</div>

<p>As the ranch-wagons stopped at the wide porch
of the solidly-built house which Polly remembered
so well, Eleanor and she gazed in wide-eyed astonishment
at the <i>smallness</i> of the structure. It
had been remembered as being a large, low building;
but after all their tours of Europe, South
America, and the recent views of the New York
and the Chicago sky-scrapers, Polly’s old home
seemed almost too small to accommodate all these
visitors.</p>

<p>Sary came bounding out of the kitchen door,
much the same Sary as the one who had welcomed
Eleanor and her sister the day they first arrived
at Pebbly Pit. Then Jeb shuffled up with a sheepish
expression to greet the new-comers. Mr.
Dalken knew just how to reach the hearts of others,
and he shook hands with Sary and Jeb, saying,
as he did so, that he had a token from South
America for them in his baggage. That gave
him the place of honor, during that visit to the
ranch.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander had been at the gold mine all
that week, and John explained to the eager questioners
that he would be back the following morning.
He had been determined to attend personally
to such interests at Choko’s Find as might
be bettered by his presence and expert advice;
and, since he would be absent so long on the proposed
trip to Arizona, he thought it best to
forego the pleasure of being present when the
guests arrived at the ranch.</p>

<p>The next two weeks sped swiftly by, and then
came the time when, business conferences over between
the men, the Dalken party, with Mr. Alexander
taking the place of guide instead of Mr.
Dalken, were on the eve of departure for Arizona
and new adventures in the southwest.</p>

<p>“We’ll be wondering what you are doing to-morrow,
this time,” remarked Polly, <i>apropos</i> of
her mother’s saying that the place would seem
deserted after the young folks had gone.</p>

<p>“Tom will be able to keep us informed upon
those points,” was Mr. Alexander’s reply. “He
is well-acquainted with the ranch-rule, and all we
have to do, when we need information, will be to
ask him what time the folks do this, or what are
the home-people doing now.”</p>

<p>Polly looked surprised and failed to grasp Mr.
Alexander’s meaning. Eleanor must have sensed
it, however, for she quickly exclaimed: “Will
Tom be sitting at a radio-instrument, or does he
carry a pocket-telephone around with him, that he
can answer the moment we wish to call him up?”
She laughed, but her words showed she wished to
be given a cue to Mr. Alexander’s speech.</p>

<p>“Why, no! Tom will be right beside you to
reply, if you are kind enough to permit it,” explained
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Tom! You don’t mean he is going with us,
do you?” asked Polly, too amazed to disguise
her annoyance.</p>

<p>At this tone, Tom forgot Anne’s wise admonitions
and flared up in anger. “Yes, I am! I
find that every one but you seems anxious to have
my company on this excursion, because they understand
that I am of some value to them. However,
that need not interfere with <i>your</i> happiness,—I’ll
take mighty good care not to come within
ten rods of you, when it can be helped!” Polly
was so astonished at Tom’s irritation and his
words that she stared at him in silence. Eleanor
almost laughed outright at the expression upon
her chum’s face.</p>

<p>Jack mumbled something about “The worm
hath turned,” and Mrs. Courtney gave him a
vicious dig in the ribs to silence him. Then she
whispered behind Polly’s back: “You’ll go and
ruin everything, you rascal!”</p>

<p>Tom now got up and, saying “Good-night,”
stalked from the room. No one saw him again
that evening, and in the early morning, when the
heavy wagon drew up to the steps for the visitors,
Tom was already seated beside Jeb. It developed,
then, that he had said good-by to the
Brewster family before the Dalken party had appeared
for breakfast.</p>

<p>During the long drive over the trails which led
to Oak Creek, Tom devoted his attention to Jeb.
When the wagon pulled up at the horse-trough
near the station, Tom shook hands with Jeb and
sprang down to assist Mrs. Courtney in alighting.
Then he escorted her to the platform and stood
conversing with her until the local steamed into
the station. He had not spoken a word to Polly
since the previous evening.</p>

<p>In the train, he seated himself beside Mrs.
Courtney and entertained her with accounts of
the tremendous undertaking of safely mining the
gold ore from Choko’s Find on Grizzly Slide. In
fact, so well did he fulfill his part, that that lady
voted him one of the most intelligent and courteous
young men she had ever met. At the same
time she could not understand how Polly Brewster
could help loving Tom with all her heart.
He was handsome, well-bred, highly educated,
and had all the money a girl might crave—and
best of all, he had loved her with the earnestness,
persistence, and whole-mindedness of his one-track
heart.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m going to see to it that that girl has
her eyes opened during this trip!” thought Mrs.
Courtney to herself.</p>

<p>But Polly and Eleanor were whispering between
themselves, and their plotting might be considered
along the same lines as those of the chaperon.
Mr. Dalken, engrossed with Mr. Alexander,
had left the girls to choose between Jack’s
society or exchange personal confidences; they
chose the latter as being the lesser of two tiresome
evils. Hence Jack went forward to smoke,
and the two girls began to plan just how they
might bring about a settled state of affairs
between Mrs. Courtney and their dear friend,
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“We ought to have clean sailing in the next few
months, Nolla,” said Polly. “No other man or
woman to interfere in the match, you know.”</p>

<p>“But Dalky will be so taken up with schemes,
and going off to investigate holes in the ground,
that Mrs. Courtney will feel disgusted.”</p>

<p>“‘Absence makes the heart grow fonder,’”
quoth Polly, laughing. “Just because he won’t always
be at beck and call, and because he compares
so favorably with other men, it will be an incentive
to her love—if she feels any.”</p>

<p>“If! There’s that awful ‘if’ in the way!”
sighed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, Nolla, we ought to be able to
find out one of two things on this western trip—whether
she does love him, or whether she
doesn’t! I’m not so sure but that daily companionship
on board a private yacht is coma to spontaneous
love. You can always tell, from day to
day, just what is about to happen, and who will
be in the party. Now, out here, where great
things occur frequently, these two may discover
how dear each is to the other. I’ve known hurricanes,
land-slides, and little things like that, to be
instrumental in opening the eyes of lovers.”
Polly spoke as though the “trifles” just mentioned
were casual incidents in a westerner’s life.</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed. “I’m from the Windy City,
Poll, but I’m sure we wouldn’t consider a hurricane
or an Omaha cyclone ‘little things’ to help
on a love-affair. Better let nature take its
course.”</p>

<p>So plotted two pairs of match-makers: the two
girls on the one side, and Mrs. Courtney and
Tom (who felt intuitively that he had a champion in her) on the other side. Which pair would
win the first place, in successfully bringing about
an understanding, in regard to the others remained
to be seen—there also remained the long
winter in balmy Arizona, during which the two
affairs might thrive splendidly. Who could tell?</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III</span><br />
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>DODO JOINS THE RANKS</span>
</h2>

<p>Back in Denver once more, Mr. Alexander
found a telegram awaiting him. In it he read
that his wife and daughter would leave Colorado
Springs and planned to arrive in the city that
same evening, as Mrs. Alexander had unexpectedly
decided to join the travelers to Arizona.</p>

<p>“Now, what d’ye think of that?” exclaimed
little Mr. Alexander, snapping the telegram with
impatient fingers. “It’s all right for Dodo to
come, but my wife isn’t used to roughin’ it—least-ways,
she don’t care for it, since we got so much
money to spend.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall enjoy having another woman help
me to keep all the girls in order,” remarked Mrs.
Courtney, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“Don’t fool yourself, Madam—my wife isn’t
goin’ to be much help in lookin’ after others.
She demands all the lookin’ after for herself. I
gen’ally see to it that she has a lady’s maid to
wait on her—that lets me out of buttonin’ her
boots, and runnin’ here and there like a beast of
burden, to take or carry her shawl, or parasol, or
smellin’ salts. Since she’s takin’ to golf and tennis,
it’s her golf-bag or the tennis racquet I’m expected
to carry. I’m sorry to have to explain so
much of my family troubles to you, Madam, but
you must know that I hate to play caddie, though
my wife says I resemble one.” The humility and
meekness of the little man made Mrs. Courtney
feel as though she must stand by him in some
way—just as Polly’s friends had felt, as soon as
they had grown to understand him on that European
tour.</p>

<p>“If you really wish to secure a competent lady’s
maid for your wife, maybe I might help you in
seeking for one in the city to-day,” ventured Mrs.
Courtney, though she realized what a social
error she was committing in offering to engage a
maid for another woman.</p>

<p>“Oh, say! If you’d do that for me, Madam,
I’ll never forget it. I want to give my time to
Mr. Dalken and the men we hope to meet here in
Denver and, later on, in Prescott. If Mrs. Alexander
demands my attention, how can I serve two
masters?” appealed the little man.</p>

<p>“Just tell me the kind of maid I ought to hire,
and I’ll move heaven and earth to find one for
you,” promised Mrs. Courtney; at the same time
she wondered what had come over her to make
her step into another woman’s place in this way,
and thus force that woman to give the husband
all the spare time he craved to attend to business
affairs. But Mrs. Courtney had no idea that she
was acting because of her deep interest in the
South American land plans, in which Mr. Dalken
had not only committed himself as well as his
keen business brain, but also had signed for great
blocks of stock that would bankrupt him should
the scheme fail.</p>

<p>“It <i>must not</i> fail!” said Mrs. Courtney, vehemently,
to herself.</p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Polly and Eleanor
were invited to accompany their chaperon to one
of the best employment offices in Denver that
same afternoon of their arrival at the hotel. And
to their amusement, they heard and saw Mrs.
Courtney interrogate several maids, believing as
she did, that maids out west must be much like
maids in New York. She was soon informed to
the contrary however.</p>

<p>To her questions of “Can you dress hair stylishly?” “Do you wash and mend laces neatly?”
“Are you experienced in manicuring?” “and in
preparing the bath?” and other personal attentions,
she heard to her surprise: “I kin darn
socks, lady”; or “I have sewed clothes sence I
was knee-high to a prairie-dog”; or, perhaps, the
applicant would explain, “I ain’t no common general
worker, lady, but I kin do plain cookin’, er
lend a hand at the wash-tub, when it’s called for.
I even will agree to het the water fer the baths,
ef so come yuh-all need it that way.”</p>

<p>Hence the polished society woman from the
East had to confess herself vanquished in her effort
to help Mr. Alexander provide a lady’s maid
for his wife. On the way back to the hotel Polly
made a suggestion which Eleanor thought would
prove very exciting, if not practical, for Mrs.
Alexander’s future peace and personal comfort.</p>

<p>“Why waste time in finding a maid for Dodo’s
mother when we can get a first-class Indian servant,
who will cook, pack, wash, and do everything
else for the men, when they have to camp in
the mountains; then he can work for Mrs. Alexander,
when the men are with us and have no need
of the Guide.”</p>

<p>“But, Polly, Mrs. Alexander will not need an
Indian to cook or wash for her—she wants a
maid to look after her comfort in the hotels
along the beaten track,” argued Eleanor.</p>

<p>“If she annexes herself and her wardrobe
trunks to our select party, she’ll have to put up
with discomforts in Arizona, even as we are willing
to do,” declared Polly, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve done all I could to smooth away
the obstacles from little Mr. Alexander’s pathway—now
it is up to his wife to find her own
maid,” complained Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>That evening Eleanor amused the men by describing
the visit at the employment office and
the interviews with sundry maids. Mr. Alexander
felt deeply obliged to Mrs. Courtney, but she
begged him to forget it, since she had not succeeded
as she had promised him.</p>

<p>About eight o’clock that same evening, a commotion
outside the hotel entrance announced the
arrival of Mrs. Alexander and her daughter.
This time, the commotion was caused by the taxi
running head on into a costly limousine which
was waiting for its owner. Not only the scene
between the two chauffeurs, but also the hysterical
screams from the lady inside the cab, drew a
crowd that refused to be dispersed until an officer
came running up to arrest the culprits—should
he find any.</p>

<p>Jack and Tom had been the first of the loungers
in the hotel-lobby to hurry to the street and
watch the altercation between the two drivers;
but the moment they saw Dodo gazing anxiously
from the taxi window, they sprang across the sidewalk
and quickly opened the door.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, Jack, you’re here to get
mother out of this!” cried Dodo, in relief. Then
she managed to slip her arm underneath her
mother’s, and urged her to get up and out of the
cab.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander spied handsome Jack, and
quickly decided she must lean upon the strong
right arm of a young man, instead of accepting
her daughter’s equally strong arm. With a rolling
of her eyes between pencilled eyelashes, and a
plaintive gasp meant to enlist Jack’s sympathy,
Mrs. Alexander permitted herself to be coaxed
from the cab, and half-carried into the hotel.
How she loved all this confusion, which she considered
better than nothing, in the absence of
other ways of announcing her arrival!</p>

<p>“Well, so here you are, my dear!” exclaimed
little Mr. Alexander, coming from the smoking-room, in time to see his wife sink upon a huge
lounge in the large reception hall.</p>

<p>Had it not been that Mr. Dalken, Tom, and
the ladies now hastened to greet the new arrivals,
Mrs. Alexander might have amused herself by
scolding her spouse for his neglect in meeting her
train at the station—though she had failed to
mention in the telegram the time of its arrival
in Denver. Being the center of interest, because
of the fuss she made over the collision in front
of the hotel, Mrs. Alexander forgot to take her
husband to account for his oversight of duty.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken had planned to leave Denver the
following morning—in fact, he would not have
stopped over-night at the hotel, had it not been
for the wire received by Mr. Alexander, in which
Mrs. Alexander said she would join the party in
Denver that evening.</p>

<p>Now, to end the lady’s little tableau, Mr.
Dalken looked at his watch. “We must retire,
friends, if we wish to get the train to Albuquerque
to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Mrs. Alexander, “I cannot think
of it! I have a great deal of shopping to attend
to and, besides, I promised faithfully that Dodo
and I would wait here for a certain dear friend
to join us. He leaves the Springs in the morning,
and I am sure he will be with us by noon.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” demanded her little lord and
master. “Not a fool who’s after Dodo’s money,
I hope.”</p>

<p>“Ebeneezer! How can you speak so shamelessly
of your child’s admirers?” complained Mrs.
Alexander.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Daddy,” added Dodo, frankly
as ever. “He makes a fine fetch-and-carry addition
to Ma’s cortège, and I don’t mind him a bit—he
manages to dust his wisp of a moustache
upon my finger-tips now and then, and that
seems to pay him for his doglike devotion
to Ma.”</p>

<p>“But why wait for him to come to Denver?”
demanded her father.</p>

<p>“Why—because Ma invited him to join your
party on its trip to Arizona. She thinks the invigorating
climate may cause certain dormant
brain cells in sweet little Algy’s cerebrum to open.
If that should develop, think how thankful we
would be!” Dodo laughed heartlessly.</p>

<p>“Poor Dodo!” whispered Eleanor to Polly.
“What a life she must have had with her mother,
at such a resort as the Hot Springs.”</p>

<p>“Darling child!” cried Mrs. Alexander, reprovingly,
to Dodo. “Some day you will appreciate
such a devoted love as adoring Algernon
has for you. At present you are too young to
understand it.”</p>

<p>“I am as old as Polly and Eleanor, Ma, in
spite of your denials of my true age. I think it
is too silly for anything—the way you tell people
how grown up I am for my tender age! How
much older I <i>look</i> than I really <i>am</i>! That I ought
to be in school, with my hair in pigtails! Now,
I’m going to have it out, since Daddy is here to
stand by me. The next time you start in to sigh
about my precociousness for my age, I’m going to
tell right out how old <i>you</i> are. I’m going to inform
people that you married very late in life,
and that I am a child of your old age.”</p>

<p>Ebeneezer Alexander smiled approvingly at his
daughter’s threat, and the others in the group
had difficulty in controlling their facial muscles—not
that the elders approved of such remarks to
a parent, but Mrs. Alexander’s was an exceptional
case, and Dodo happened to be a very frank, even
blunt, character, much like her father’s. Mrs.
Courtney heard and saw the attitude between
mother and daughter, and she was intelligent
enough to understand the situation without any
other explanations. She felt that possibly she
might be of great service to both.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Alexander now commanded all attention.
Dodo’s speech could not be denied by
her, so she took refuge in her usual way—hysterics.
All present, but Dodo and her father,
rushed around in search for smelling-salts and
other remedies, but the two who should have been
most concerned were least concerned. They understood
that the third member of the family
would come out of her attack instantly, once she
realized no one paid any attention to her.
Now, however, she continued the pretension as
long as there seemed hope of annoying others.</p>

<p>“I sure am sorry to interrupt you-all from
waitin’ on my missus, folks,” finally said Mr.
Alexander, “but I got to get to bed, ‘cause we’re
goin’ to make an early start.”</p>

<p>This made his wife forget her recent indisposition.
She sat up.</p>

<p>“Ebeneezer! I told you that I could not get
ready to start away from here so early as you
plan. I have to do necessary shopping for myself
and Dodo,” exclaimed she.</p>

<p>“I will pass up the shopping, Ma, because I
really prefer going on with the rest of the party,”
said Dodo, quickly.</p>

<p>“Children must be seen not——” Mrs. Alexander
began, but she suddenly remembered her
daughter’s threat to expose her true age, and she
sighed aloud.</p>

<p>“If you say you must shop fer things, you can
stay over and come along on another train. Our’s
won’t be the last one out of Denver, you know,”
ventured Mr. Alexander, hopefully.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that your shopping will detain you
here, and not permit you to go on with us in the
morning,” added Mr. Dalken, hoping to end the
argument, and to show the lady that he was obdurate
over her selfishness.</p>

<p>“You men might go on, and we ladies follow
in the afternoon,” suggested Mrs. Alexander, appealing
to Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>“No,” instantly retorted her spouse. “We got
all the mileage on one ticket, and the crowd can’t
break up that way. You make up your mind to
stay and shop, and at the same time hire a maid
for yourself to go down to the desert of Arizona,
and we’ll go on and wait for you at Albuquerque.”</p>

<p>The evident desire of her liege lord to be rid
of her society, even for a day, caused the contrary
woman to change her plans. “I will sacrifice myself
and all my appointments in Denver for you,
dear Ebeneezer. What time must I be ready in
the morning?”</p>

<p>“Huh! All this time and talk wasted—might
have said this in the start!” snorted Mr. Alexander,
marching away without replying to his
wife’s honeyed question.</p>

<p>Now the other members in the party believed
Mrs. Alexander was persuaded to go with them
before noon the following day. But those who
had crossed wills with her in England and, later,
on the Continent, might have known her better.
The next day proved that Mrs. Alexander had
won her point; she acted <i>too</i> guileless about it to
deceive any one.</p>

<p>It had been decided to take the eleven-forty
train from Denver, but this decision came to
naught much to the aggravation of the men.
Polly and Eleanor, knowing as they did Mrs.
Alexander’s stock of tricks, had to laugh at this
newest one.</p>

<p>Everything was ready, and cabs were called to
take the tourists to the station. Bags, girls and
all were settled in the taxis, and the men were
impatiently waiting for Mrs. Alexander to appear. Finally, at the very last moment in which
they might reach the train by speeding the cars,
she came out to the curb. Just as she was going
to step inside her cab, she cried in alarm and
sank down upon the curb.</p>

<p>Naturally her male companions sprang over to
help her up, but she could not stand. She hung
limply between Mr. Dalken and her husband.
Meanwhile she groaned and seemed in genuine
distress.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Maggie, what ails you now?”
wailed little Mr. Alexander, wishing to thrust her
into the cab, in order to permit them to drive on.</p>

<p>“Take me back to the hotel! I cannot go——”
she seemed to grow faint and her head drooped
forward.</p>

<p>“She’s ill, Mr. Alexander,” whispered Mr.
Dalken, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll lift her in the cab, and the air’ll
bring her to, as soon as the driver starts,” suggested
her husband.</p>

<p>The chauffeur now ventured a disconcerting announcement.
“If you-all planned to catch the
noon express, you’re goin’ to be disappointed.
Can’t possibly make it now, not if you had wings
to fly there.”</p>

<p>“Why, man, we’ve <i>got</i> to catch it! Made
dates with business men for to-morrow,” said
Jack impatiently, looking at his watch.</p>

<p>“Too bad, but you-all can understand that I’m
not talking for my own good, seein’ that I’m losin’
all these fares to the station,” said the driver.</p>

<p>“He’s kerrect, Jack!” cried Mr. Alexander, in
distress. “No use scootin’ to catch that train.
Gotta wait fer the five o’clock now.” But his expression
boded no future peace to his wife, who
had been the cause of the delay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander was too wise an actress to revive
immediately after she had won her game.
She allowed them to carry her into the ladies’
parlor, and there she secured the interest of the
maid by slipping her a liberal tip to attend upon
her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney remained with the sighing lady,
but the girls would not join them, lest Dodo express
her candid opinion of this unusual incident.
In fact, it was all Polly could do to restrain Dodo
from telling her mother what she believed to be
the truth; and the men were equally engaged in
keeping Mr. Alexander from announcing to his
wife his intentions to divorce her. Mr. Dalken
laughed and explained that a husband had to
prove more serious misdemeanors on the part of
a wife than clever acting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander revived quickly, once she had
gained her point, and by the time Mr. Algernon
Alveston was announced, she had regained her
usual strength of mind, as well as strength of
ankles—the weakness which had caused her
graceful subsidence upon the curb seemed to have
vanished like magic.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken’s party had given up their rooms
at the hotel, at the time they believed themselves
to be leaving for the train; then it became necessary
for the Alexanders to engage another suite
to allow the indisposed lady to recover without
being annoyed by strangers.</p>

<p>Every member of the Dalken party, except Mrs.
Alexander, was waiting in the luxurious lounge
for further news of the invalid, when a thin, sallow-faced,
silver-haired youth pranced into the
hotel and glanced eagerly around. He must have
been weak-sighted, because Dodo was a prominent
figure in the waiting party of friends, yet the
newcomer failed to see her.</p>

<p>“Oh, goodness!” whispered Dodo. “There’s
Algy,—spats, cane and monocle!”</p>

<p>The others had seen the ridiculous-looking
young man, and now they gasped at Dodo’s information.
Was <i>that</i> the cause of their hold-up?
Mr. Alexander frowned ominously, as he muttered
aloud: “Where’d he come from, Dodo?
And how long’ve you known him?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t seem to know himself where he
hailed from,” tittered Dodo, getting back of her
friends to avoid being spied by the little green eye
back of the monocle. “As for time in which to
know him, Daddy, a minute or two is sufficient.
There’s nothing more to discover, once you’ve
had a look at his clothes and general get-up.”</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor giggled, because Dodo’s description
seemed to fit the object perfectly. Then
they suddenly turned their attention to each other
and seemed deeply interested in what the gentlemen
were saying,—because a bell-hop was seen
to take a card from the clerk and leave the desk.
In a few seconds thereafter, he began to page
“Mrs. Alexander! Mrs. Alexander!”</p>

<p>“S—sh! don’t one of you dare to reply to
that!” warned Mr. Alexander, making sure that
Dodo was safely screened from view by the girls
and Mrs. Courtney. “If that swell collar-ad
over there’s called to see Mrs. Alexander, let her
answer the call. It ain’t fer you ner me, Dodo!”</p>

<p>Having paraded all around the public rooms on
the first floor, the bell-hop was returning to the
desk with the card in his hand, when the vigilant
clerk spied the Alexanders in Mr. Dalken’s party.</p>

<p>“There, you’ll find out where the lady is by asking
of her husband or daughter—over by the
palms,” said the clerk. Then Mr. Alexander saw
the boy hurry across the lobby in his direction.</p>

<p>The little man drew himself up, to look as majestic
as possible, before he turned to stare at the
bell-boy. “You say this caller is for my wife?
Well, I’ll go and entertain him, until she comes
in.”</p>

<p>Without another word, Mr. Alexander started
off, but Dodo felt it would surely create a divorce
in her family if her father was permitted to interview
Mr. Alveston alone—perhaps he would tell
him he was holding up a private touring party,
and then ask him to get out of the way. It was
well known that Mr. Alexander stood on little
ceremony and lost no time in speaking bluntly to
people who caused him any annoyance. Therefore
it happened that Dodo got her two girl-friends
to hurry with her at the heels of her
father. All four approached the caller about the
same time.</p>

<p>Algernon Alveston sprang up from the great
leather chair, in which he had been quite lost, and
gave his coat and vest a nervous yank to
straighten out any possible creases. Then he
flicked off an imaginary speck of dust from his
sleeve, and “hem-hem-ed” several times, before
he was ready to welcome Dodo and her friends.</p>

<p>Dodo stood still, expecting Algy to join her,
then she would prevent her father from taking a
high hand in the addition of the young man to the
touring party.</p>

<p>Algernon’s spirit was willing to fulfill Dodo’s
wishes, but his head was weak. As he nervously
started to greet Dodo and be introduced to her
father and the two handsome girls beside her, his
extremely pointed-toed shoe caught in the long
fringe of the Turkish rug. Presto! away went
the dapper youth, as though he was performing a
fancy dance for the benefit of his audience. In
fact, his body seemed to be suspended above the
floor in a horizontal position instead of being upright.</p>

<p>Even so, he might have eventually balanced
himself, in order to gain a vertical position, as
man was meant to be, had it not been for his
thick, heavy walking-stick. As he went two-stepping over the carpet, the cane struck the table
legs and came back like a boomerang. In another
moment it had managed to get between his
weak knees, and in another moment Algy was
measuring his full length upon the floor directly
in front of little Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>It was all done in so short a time that the girls
had not had leisure to catch their breaths, and
Mr. Alexander was not provided with any other
exclamation than his favorite one, which always
came from him like a blast from a small furnace.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon! What’cha
floppin’ in front o’ me for? I ain’t no royal personage
waitin’ to have my subjecks kiss my shoe,
like-as-how you Britons do, when you got a favor
to ask. Now, git up, and behave like a <i>real</i> man.”
With this advice, Mr. Alexander assisted Algy
by kicking the troublesome cane out of the way.</p>

<p>“Ah,—I beg pawdin; aw, I neveh thought of
saluting you, Mr. Alexandeh. It was owing to a
trifling catch of my boot on the rug,” explained
Algy, rising awkwardly to his feet, and groping
about for his beloved monocle. So nervous was
he, that he adjusted the eye-glass and never realized
that the fall had loosened and lost the glass.
He wore the fine gold-wire rim as though the
glass was there.</p>

<p>“Yeh, I noticed the triflin’ trip,” smiled Mr.
Alexander.</p>

<p>Algy interpreted the smile as one of paternal
sympathy, and never dreamed that Dodo’s father
was actually laughing at the vapid admirer who
seemed so feather-brained.</p>

<p>“Weally, Miss Dodo, I must apologize for
such accidental behavior on my part. I feah I
frightened you a bit, but I assure you it was owing
to that trifling trip,” repeated Algy, finding it
difficult to think of any new sentence.</p>

<p>“As Daddy said, ‘never mind.’ Remember you
are out west now, and not in your oft-quoted
British Isles. You must know how awfully
democratic father is—just the opposite of you,
Mr. Alveston.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! Perhaps youh fatheh will convert
my views on democracy. At pwesent, howeveh, I
am a thoroughbred autocrat with tendencies toward
my English ancestry.” Algy was not very
clear about his tendencies, thought Polly, as she
stood listening very seriously.</p>

<p>“Naturally you would have ancestral tendencies—every one has,” laughed Dodo; then Algy
was ready to be presented.</p>

<p>“In these modern days, the young folks gen’ally
take after themselves,” grunted Mr. Alexander.
“All the same, ef this young feller is like his ancestors
was, it’s a lucky thing they didn’t have
rugs with fringes on ’em in the old times.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander’s remark was quite lost, however,
because Algy was being introduced, and he
never grasped more than one thing at a time. At
the moment, he was grasping Polly’s fingers in
order to waft a dainty kiss upon their tips in
salute. Then came Eleanor’s turn. And at last,
Mr. Alexander was introduced. The little man
scowled at the excessively polite young man, and
seemed to be ready to defend himself in case his
fingers were lifted to those thin, white lips.</p>

<p>Just as the formal introductions ended, Jack
strolled over and called out cheerily: “Oh, here
you are! Found, the friend Mrs. Alexander
thought to be lost, strayed or stolen?”</p>

<p>Tom had accompanied Jack, but he remained
in the open doorway, annoyed at what he saw.
He had appeared just in time to see Algy kiss
Polly’s fingers, and he felt like cuffing the little
dandy’s ears for such impertinence.</p>

<p>Now, however, he crossed the room and spoke
impatiently to Polly. “Why do you permit that
Jackanapes to perform as he did?”</p>

<p>“Why—what do you mean, Tom?” asked
Polly, surprised.</p>

<p>“Well, you know very well! A man who loves
a girl hates to see her made a fool of in a public
place,” retorted Tom, forgetting Anne Brewster’s
advices and allowing his jealousy to show itself
again.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare speak like that to me! I am
not made a fool of by you or any other man, and
I refuse to allow any one to correct me—especially
in a public place, and before all my friends.”
With this reply, Polly turned and marched away.</p>

<p>Too late Tom remembered what Anne had
tried to teach him, but it seemed too late now to
make amends. He watched Polly go, and then,
instead of running up to apologize and explain
himself, he decided that this was no place for
him. He then went to the porter and asked him
to transfer his baggage to a cab which he would
get to take him to the Denver railway station.
Leaving a note of explanation for Mr. Dalken,
he slipped away, and that afternoon was on his
way back to Oak Creek. Long before he reached
his destination, however, he had time to regret
his hasty act. How he had longed for this very
wonderful tour with Polly and her friends, and
now because of his demon jealousy all was spoiled
again!</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>JACK AND ALGY ENTERTAIN</span>
</h2>

<p>That evening the tourists were seated in their
Pullman, interested in the scenery along the route—no,
not all were thus engaged, for the Alexanders
were otherwise concerned. Mr. Alexander
had not recovered his habitual good-nature
since his wife’s clever manner of compelling her
friends to wait for her latest fad, Algy.</p>

<p>“Why, in the name of conscience, didn’t you-all
get on the train at the Springs, ’stead of making
us this trouble by coming to Denver for nuthing?”
growled the little man.</p>

<p>“Ma said she had shopping to do,” explained
Dodo.</p>

<p>“She could’ve shopped at Albuquerque, all
right,” continued Mr. Alexander. “If we’d picked
you-all up at the Springs, it would have saved
Mr. Dalken a hull day’s time. We got a big date
on at the hotel in Albuquerque, and now all this
tom-foolery might spoil things.”</p>

<p>“You are so heartless, Ebeneezer!” whimpered
Mrs. Alexander, using a costly, lace-edged handkerchief
to soothe her troubled spirit.</p>

<p>“Yeh! I’ve heard so before,” grunted her
angry husband.</p>

<p>“Poor Algernon understands a woman’s sensitive
nerves far better than you ever can, Ebeneezer,”
continued Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>That was a little too much for the annoyed
man’s temper. He sat glaring across the car at
the inoffensive, blonde-pated, insignificant young
man, and snorted so that Polly and Eleanor
plainly heard what he said. “If your beau-ideal
understands <i>any</i>thing, he kin understand you, all
right, Maggie—’cause there ain’t so much to understand
as you’d like to think!”</p>

<p>This was a trifle too deep for Mrs. Alexander’s
intelligence, but she felt the sarcasm in his tone,
and she resented the use he made of her detested
first name.</p>

<p>“Mr. Alexander! how often must I inform you
that my name is not ‘Maggie’—I am to be called
‘Marguerite,’ or nothing! I ought to know my
own name, I reckon!”</p>

<p>“It usta be Maggie long enough, afore I struck
that pay dirt! If I hadn’t piled up money in
spite of myself sence then, you’d still be plain
Maggie Alexander, doin’ your own washin’ and
cookin’, and not a thought of chasin’ young fellers
for Dodo to marry.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare remind me of those horrible
days!” cried Mrs. Alexander, her face red as a
peony, as she glanced covertly around to assure
herself that no one else had overheard her husband’s
revelations.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t hurt your feelin’s, if you’d behave
and not drag these ever-lastin’ dudes around the
country, tryin’ to tag ’em to Dodo’s apron-strings.
That gal’s as much mine as she is yourn, and I
got a word to say about the man she wants to
marry! Remember that, Maggie!”</p>

<p>Once more his wife looked daggers at him, and
then she reiterated: “I’ll have you call me Marguerite,
or nothing at all, Mr. Alexander!”</p>

<p>“So be it! I’ll remember to call you ‘Nothin’-at-all’
after this, but I swear I shan’t call you no
high-falutin names like Marguerite! It’d gag me—tryin’
to fit such a fancy name onto my plain,
old wife!” As he dropped this last bomb, Mr.
Alexander got up and went forward to the smoking
compartment.</p>

<p>In another moment Algy, seeing his opportunity, came over to take the vacated seat. But
Dodo would not remain beside him, so she got
up, excused herself, and joined Polly and Eleanor.
Jack saw his chance for amusement, and he
crossed the aisle to take Dodo’s vacant place.</p>

<p>The train had reached Colorado Springs, and
the tourists had been interested in looking at
Pike’s Peak and Manitou in the moonlight, so
that only part of the Alexanders’ altercation had
been heard by them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander turned to Algy and simpered
affectedly: “Oh, what sweet memories come back
at sight of this delightful resort!”</p>

<p>Algernon, his slow brain seldom grasping any
idea until others had forgotten what had been
said, merely smiled vacantly at the speaker and
nodded his head. Jack gazed in impatient astonishment
at Mrs. Alexander, then he turned and
stared at the simpleton.</p>

<p>“The wonderful motor trips, Mr. Baxter, and
the stunning women—genuine fashion leaders
from New York and abroad, they are—that are
at the Springs,” sighed the lady, her mind dwelling
upon the “fashion-plates” she had seen in the
resort.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve heard that Colorado Springs is a
great center to attract the salaried women of New
York, Chicago, and European cities, who are paid
to display toilettes which are expected to win
favor with the ladies—in this way the fashions
are made for you, just as they are done in France
and England. I suppose you know that?” said
Jack, innocently.</p>

<p>“I believe so,” murmured Mrs. Alexander, uncertain
of what was the best reply to make.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” now came happily from Algy, as
his expression denoted he had grasped some elusive
joy. “Yes, dear lady, I can see you now,
wearing one of those becoming costumes, about
to motor with your wonderful child, to one of the
famous points of interest.”</p>

<p>Jack had almost forgotten the exclamation
Mrs. Alexander had made a short time before,
and she had <i>quite</i> forgotten it, since she only
spoke to show Jack that she was a member of the
gay society at the Springs. Now, however, she
frowned disapprovingly at Algy, thinking he was
speaking of the parade of fashions for a fee.
How could he think that!</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor were sitting with Dodo just
across the aisle, and the conversation of the three
was plainly heard. They found much to do to
keep from laughing merrily at Jack’s subtle teasing.</p>

<p>Then Dodo whispered to her chums: “Algy will
be getting in deep water if he fences with Jack.
He’d better watch his step, or he’ll go in over his
head.”</p>

<p>“You say it is too empty to be damaged,”
laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Yes, but it may fill with water, you see,” retorted
Dodo.</p>

<p>“It may float like a cork, Dodo,” now giggled
Polly.</p>

<p>“No danger! It is too much of a vacuum,”
added Dodo.</p>

<p>“S-sh!” warned Eleanor, hearing Jack continue
the conversation with the two other entertainers.</p>

<p>“I suppose you played golf a great deal at the
Springs, Mrs. Alexander?” asked he, politely.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I simply adore that game,” exclaimed
the lady. “I have been told that my teeing
is a sight to behold! Several elderly gentlemen,
stopping at the same hotel, complimented
me on my form in using the mashie. That is a
very difficult stick to use properly, you know.
Then, too, I was told that the graceful manner
in which I handled the niblick every time I made a
great drive, was a treat for old players of the
famous game.”</p>

<p>“I can well imagine how old players of the
game were amazed at your form,” returned Jack,
not a smile crimping the corners of his mouth.
The three girls, however, laughed into their handkerchiefs,
and Dodo explained her amusement at
her mother’s words, by saying: “Girls, Ma never
took a stick from the bag that Algy toted all over
the course. The two of them just walked slowly
around, because it was the thing to do, and many
a good player swore at them for getting right in
the way. One day, during a four-some between
some famous golfers, Ma and Algy managed to
get right in the way. One of the men shouted impatiently:
‘Fore!’ And Ma turned to smile
sweetly at them, then she replied: ‘I know it,
thank you. I’ve heard you four were wonderful
players. Don’t mind me watching you.’ Do you
wonder I have to laugh as I remember?”</p>

<p>During Dodo’s whispered explanation, Jack
had said something which the girls had missed.
Mrs. Alexander was replying to him.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, indeed! Just ask Algy to prove it.
He always carried my bag, you see, so he was
present whenever I finished the game in a few
hundred strokes.” She beamed upon Algy for
him to convince the young New Yorker of her
skill in beating the record. And the youth, thus
called upon before he could muster his wits on the
proper answer to give, spoke recklessly, but he
never realized it.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Alexander walked so much every morning,
over those links, that she really weighed nine
pounds less when she left the Springs. I told her
it was a pity she could not carry her own golf-bag,
because that would have taken off five extra
pounds, I’m sure. I lost that much, and I really
felt that I had no right to lose an ounce. It almost
ruined my figure, losing those five pounds,
you know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander sent Algy a second dagger-like
look, but he sat smiling upon Jack, who was the
one addressed. Jack was not the one to disappoint
any one, and in this case he fairly reveled
in entertaining those about him.</p>

<p>“I believe it is a real strain—to have to caddy
to another. Not so bad, when one carries one’s
own bag, but the fun is missed when the caddy
cannot use the sticks he has to carry.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there!” agreed Algy. “There
were plenty of paid caddies, understand, but dear
Mrs. Alex. is so particular, and I had nothing
else to do, you know, so we hit it off fine in golf.”</p>

<p>The train had been speeding on its way to
Pueblo, and now the tourists saw the outlying sections
of that manufacturing city come into view.
La Junta would be the next stopping place on the
railroad, but the tourists in the Dalken party were
not so concerned about getting off the train to
visit places of interest as they were in arriving
at Albuquerque in time to meet the men with
whom the important appointment had been made.
Therefore they were going through on the
sleeper.</p>

<p>Having left Pueblo behind, the younger members
in the party took up their conversation
where it had been suspended while waiting in the
station. Jack launched an entirely new form of
the same game.</p>

<p>“Your name would suggest British nationality,
Mr. Alveston.”</p>

<p>“Aw, yes!” agreed Algy, fixing his monocle in
the latest approved English manner. “My full
name, you know, is Algernon Alfred Alveston.
Quite unusual, don’t you think?—The initials, I
mean, A. A. A.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” declared Jack seriously, albeit the three girls saw a fine wrinkle at the corners
of his eyes. “It reminds one of a grade of
flour. In fact, I am sure I’ve seen the advertisements
of the ‘Aunt Jane Pancake Flour’ with the
‘A. A. A.’ to tell the quality. I suppose that is
what you refer to—the quality in your makeup,
eh?”</p>

<p>Algy was not certain that this could be considered
a compliment; nor was he certain whether
it was a covert insult. Moreover, he had no time
for either, just then, because he was engrossed
with the euphony of his name. He smiled beatifically
to himself as he repeated it.</p>

<p>“Another great publicity stunt your name suggests,”
continued Jack, finding he had not “gotten
Algy’s goat,” with his last remark, “is the rubber
trade. Now, I do not mean you to infer that I
mean the slang word ‘rubber,’ but I am thinking
of A. A. A. rubber, such as we use in washers on
hose and kitchen sinks. They are handy for other
purposes, too. Some folks wear A. A. A. rubber
under foot—to keep the soles of their feet dry,
you know. I suppose you find it dreadfully embarrassing
when your initials remind people of
their feet, and of drains, or kitchen sinks.”</p>

<p>Algy had to ponder this before he would commit himself, but Mrs. Alexander began to think
that perhaps this handsome young man might be
laughing quietly at her friend and great admirer.
Before she could grasp the situation, however,
Jack had diverted her attention to the town the
train was now approaching—La Junta.</p>

<p>“I always feel that I must take in a great
mouthful of pronunciation before I speak that
word. Then it comes with an explosive sort of
sound—‘La Hoontah!’” laughed he, purposely
keeping her from investigating his recent bout
with Algy.</p>

<p>“I have heard that it would be far better if the
men who attend to the spelling of names and
places in America would use simple spelling the
way the town is called,” said Mrs. Alexander.
“I’ve often thought of writing to the board of
men who do this work, to ask them to think of
my suggestion. It would be a great deed, to spell
names exactly as they are spoken.”</p>

<p>“Indeed it would,” agreed Jack. “For instance,
such a fine idea would save so much confusion
that you would be entitled to a memorial
in the Hall of Fame, Mrs. Alexander.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this is the least of many great ideas I
have, but so few friends ever appreciate them.
I really feel that I am repressed in my beautiful
thoughts for the world’s welfare, because my husband
and Dodo never can understand me, you
see,” explained the poor lady.</p>

<p>“Well, now that I understand you, esteemed
friend, you will not have to waste your ideals on
Algy. You may share them with me,” said Jack,
with one of his adoring glances.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander felt sweetly thrilled at such
appreciation, and suddenly Algy woke up to a remark
made ten minutes before.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say! You didn’t mean that my initials
might be in the class of flour or rubber, did you?”
He was quite aggrieved.</p>

<p>“Not at all!” retorted Jack, giving a swift look
at the girls, to make sure they were listening. “I
was only wondering how it was that you got such
a distinguished set of initials to stand for yourself,
since the world considers an ‘A. A. A.’ to be
superlative quality. In business references, you
know, the ‘A. A. A.’ signifies that the one mentioned
is absolutely trustworthy, and often it
means he is financially sound and safe to be
trusted. But your initials do not mean that for
you, do they? I suppose business references are
a foreign tongue to you.”</p>

<p>“Aw, yes!” said Algy. “It would be a bore to
have to study business, don’t you think? I neveh
had to work, and so I neveh dabble in trade
terms, you know. Speaking of foreign tongues—what
language did you mean?”</p>

<p>Dodo now whispered to her friends: “As usual,
Algy can only remember the last idea spoken. All
the others went over his head, because he could
not keep up with Jack’s speed in thinking. Isn’t
he funny?”</p>

<p>“Well, there is no use in trying to explain to
you, A. A. A., for I feel convinced that you would
never make use of such speech. You are in your
right place now, I should judge: keep on being
caddy to a patron like Mrs. Alexander, and don’t
strain your cerebrum by ever aspiring to reach
any higher altitudes than those which may be had
by climbing up the peaks in a train, or by an auto.
Even then, the rarefied air may cause you cramps
in the vacuous cellular region inside the skull.”</p>

<p>With this grandiloquent speech, Jack got up and
shook himself exactly as a shaggy dog might do
when he climbs up from a shallow pool of limpid
water—a pool with absolutely no depth but which
had seemed pleasant and inviting for a refreshing
bath. “Oftentimes it happens that reflections
from Nature’s surrounding banks mislead one in
thinking the water deeper than it really is,” remarked
Jack, as he sat down beside Dodo.</p>

<p>“No, Jack, I do not agree with you,” laughed
Dodo. “A. A. A. has nothing about him to reflect—not
even Nature. All he has a claim upon
is his grandfather’s fortune, which he is fast passing
on to those who understand how to handle it
better than he can.”</p>

<p>“If he has a fortune, why is he dangling after
you?” was Jack’s wondering comment.</p>

<p>“Good gracious!” laughed Dodo, “any one
would think I was an ugly, disagreeable, old maid,
with only my money to attract a beau.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I never meant that!” exclaimed Jack,
flushing scarlet. “You know what I think of you,
Doe; I <i>meant</i> that this simpleton could not appreciate
you or your intelligence, but I thought he
might envy you your cash. If he has enough of
that, why should he worry?”</p>

<p>“To be candid with you, Jack, I doubt if he
knows enough to say good-by where he is not
wanted. Ma tags him along because he actually
does make a good servant—and he has good
clothes and pays his own way. Ma uses him disgracefully,
as you will see, soon; but Algy doesn’t
seem to mind, nor does he realize it. As a little
pet dog, he is excellent. And he never barks nor
bites, either. That is in his favor, you will admit,”
and Dodo laughed, as she finished explaining.</p>

<p>“It may turn out to be a fortunate thing that
we could not hire a maid for Dodo’s mother,”
said Polly.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Dodo, curiously.</p>

<p>Then the girls told how Mrs. Courtney had
gone to the employment office to engage a good
lady’s maid for Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>Dodo laughed at the interviews and their
termination.</p>

<p>“Just as well you were unsuccessful in the
quest,” said she. “If mother has a maid, she becomes
so dependent upon her for the least act,
that she soon grows too heavy to feel comfortable.
Then she feels cross, because she cannot
dance and act like a girl, and, worst of all, her new
costumes never will meet. Life then becomes impossible,
until she has dieted down again. Algy
is better than a maid, because he induces her to
walk and go out with him, and that is good for
her health.”</p>

<p>At this moment the men returned from the
smoking compartment, and Mr. Dalken said:
“It’s time for bed, children.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear me, is it?” sighed Mrs. Alexander,
suddenly seeming to feel indisposed to move.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to go to bed, Maggie, if you
like to sit up and enjoy that young man’s conversation,”
returned Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“It’s not that, Ebeneezer—but I really feel as
though I were going to have one of my nervous
spells,” explained the lady, sighing again, more
emphatically this time.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon! Don’t carry on
like that, while we are travelin’!” cried her husband,
glancing anxiously about for some one to
share his troubles.</p>

<p>“I really can’t help it, dearest! When I feel
this way I am not able to recline upon a bed, or
to think of sleep.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you’d better sit up all night—and
have that boy sit up, too, to get what you need,
or to read to you and keep you from worryin’ over
yourself,” advised Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“Algy, dear boy, will you pull the bag of medicines
from under the seat. Get me the aromatic
ammonia, like a good child,” weakly requested
Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>The others of the group, all but Dodo and her
father, appeared concerned over Mrs. Alexander’s
sudden indisposition, and Mr. Dalken offered
to go through the Pullmans to find a physician.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you would, dear Mr. Dalken,” sighed
the apparently ill lady.</p>

<p>“No, no! don’t you take a step, Mr. Dalken,”
remonstrated Mr. Alexander. “Maggie’s fits always
pass off quicker when no one pays any attention
to her. I know, from years’ experience, what
ails her now. We ain’t been amusin’ her since we
started this trip, and now that we’re here to hear
and see, we’re in for my wife’s kind of scoldin’.
Ask Dodo about it, if you don’t believe me.”</p>

<p>But Dodo turned away and walked to the other
end of the car. She was wise for so young a girl,
but then she had had ample time in which to
watch and profit by her mother’s silly pretences.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander flashed a furious glance at her
husband, but she still had hopes of making herself
the center of concern, so she slumped down in the
seat and closed her eyes, at the same time she
threw up both hands and gave a gurgling breath.
Poor Algy stood beside her, trembling violently,
and wiping the perspiration from his noble (?)
brow.</p>

<p>“Say! Aw, I say! cawn’t you folks do something
to brace her up a bit? I weally haven’t the
stwength to stand by and witness the end of a
lady. Why, I cawn’t bear to see any one kill a
fly—it makes me deathly ill, don’t chaw know!”
Having expressed his sentiments, Algy turned and
fled to the smoking compartment.</p>

<p>At this moment Dodo rushed down the length
of the Pullman, and excitedly cried: “A fire! Oh,
what shall we do—there’s a fire on the train.”</p>

<p>All signs of illness vanished from Mrs. Alexander.
She sprang up and called imperatively to
Dodo’s amazed father, “Get the small bag,
Ebeneezer—it’s got my jewelry and money in it!
Hurry—and then follow me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander was out of the seat, and tearing
for the door, in another second. But Dodo
caught her arm and said quietly: “Never mind
jumping off, Ma. I had to apply radical treatment
to establish a perfect circulation of your
blood and a normal action of your nerves, you
know. There really is a fire aboard this train,
but it happens to be on the engine.”</p>

<p>“Dodo’s way of curing you, Maggie, is quicker’n better than all medicine, I see. We’ll have
to dose you the same way, if you get more fits
while we are on this trip,” added Mr. Alexander,
frowning at his erstwhile dying mate.</p>

<p>“I’ll see to it that this unnatural daughter of
mine pays for this breaking of the Commandment.
She doesn’t know a thing about ‘honoring
her mother,’ or she wouldn’t make me a joke to
the world!”</p>

<p>With this ultimatum, Mrs. Alexander yanked
aside the green curtains hanging before her berth,
and disappeared from view. Another yank
closed them back of her, and Mr. Alexander
heaved a relieved sigh.</p>

<p>“Now, with my blessing, you can all go to bed,
children. You needn’t worry—there won’t be
no more fits to-night, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Before we retire, Alexander, I want to inform
the ladies that they need not feel disturbed about
leaving the Pullman in the morning,” said Mr.
Dalken. Then he turned to the girls and Mrs.
Courtney, and said: “We have arranged with the
two other passengers of this coach to have this
particular car switched off at Santa Fé, to give
you all the rest you want. Jack is to remain with
you and escort you about the famous old city for
a day or two,—or longer if you like,—then you
can come on to Albuquerque, where Mr. Alexander
and I will be head over heels in conferences.
We are going right on, after dropping your car
at Santa Fé. And we will meet at the hotel Jack
knows about, where we may remain for a week or
more.”</p>

<h2 id='chV'

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER V</span><br />
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>IMPROMPTU AMUSEMENTS</span>
</h2>

<p>Mr. Dalken’s plan met with such approval
that the girls slept until late the morning that the
Pullman had been dropped at the side-track in
Santa Fé. When they were roused finally by the
porter, they found Jack waiting impatiently for
them to dress and follow him to the hotel. Mrs.
Alexander seemed to have recovered entirely
from her annoyance of the previous evening, and
Algy apparently had forgotten there had been
any disturbance in the harmony of the touring
party.</p>

<p>“Algy, dear,” said Mrs. Alexander, sweetly, as
she motioned to her numerous pieces of baggage,
“when you take these from the car, don’t drop
any. I have valuable things in each bag.”</p>

<p>“But, Ma, the Pullman porter will look after
the luggage,” was Dodo’s reminder.</p>

<p>“Not mine! thank you. I wouldn’t allow one
of those strangers to handle one of my bags. In
this desert land, I could never replace my cosmetics
and toilet articles. Algy loves to oblige
me, so why disappoint him?” was Mrs. Alexander’s
tart reply.</p>

<p>Algy said nothing, but he gathered the bags in
both feeble hands as well as he could. Then Jack,
taking pity on his futile efforts to hold them all,
waited for Mrs. Alexander to march off towards
the door, before he tied the seven leather bags
together with an end of rope which the porter
had handed him. Thus Algy could swing them
over his back, but it was a heavy load for one so
slender and limp.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Why don’t you carry some of
them?” asked Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Why should I? I’m paying the Pullman
porter to take all the luggage, and now that Algy
is so easy that he does whatever Mrs. Alex. asks
of him, let him obey. I am not that kind.”</p>

<p>“But he looks as though he might break in
half,” laughed Polly.</p>

<p>“May be a good turn for him—put some bone
and brawn into his frame,” chuckled Jack, watching
Mrs. Alex.’s obedient follower toddle along
the platform at the heels of the owner of the
bags.</p>

<p>As the cabs carried the tourists to the leading
hotel of Santa Fé, the girls were interested in
looking at the interesting sights of the old Spanish
city. Jack knew no more about the points of interest
than they did, but he pretended to do so,
and he drew their attention to the plaza—not
easily mistaken for anything else; and he told
them a certain old church was the Cathedral of
San Francisco, when it really was the Church of
San Miguel—but the girls did not find this error
out until later.</p>

<p>That first day was spent in visiting the quaint
old city and its ancient buildings and the new
museum and art gallery. Then the second day
was devoted to an auto trip along the scenic road
of the Pecos River, through the forests of the
Pecos, as far as the forest rangers’ headquarters
at Panchuela. That evening they stopped at
Bishop’s Lodge for supper, and drove back to
Santa Fé in the clear moonlight.</p>

<p>They had preferred driving in a large seven-passenger
car, instead of using two smaller autos,
and the young folks felt merry and high-spirited
as they crowded into their seats upon leaving the
Lodge. Soon after they started along the fine
highway to Santa Fé, Jack began to hum a popular air, and soon the three girls were singing the
words. Algy listened, but he never opened his
lips, and the expression upon his face seemed to
say that he disapproved of jazz-time songs.</p>

<p>At the end of the song Jack turned and spoke
to Algy. “What’s the matter with your vocal
chord, A. A. A.? Has it broken, or can’t you
sing anything but soprano?”</p>

<p>Algy pondered this query for a few moments,
while the girls had to smother their risibles in
their handkerchiefs. Then the troubled young
man said: “Why, I am just wondering where the
vocal chord is? Has it any connection with the
spine? You said something yesterday about violent
exercise being good for my spinal cord, and
now you ask if it is broken.” He seemed not to
have heard the question about having a soprano
voice.</p>

<p>“Why, no, A. A. A.—you are wrong on both
counts. <i>Your</i> vocal chord, because it is so high,
you know, must be located in your cranium. Any
one can tell that, by your high-toned airs. Some
day it might prove very interesting for you to
have a specialist on the brain seek for the Lost
Chord in your head. You would become famous
in a day, were he to discover it in your cerebellum,”
explained Jack.</p>

<p>Poor Algy knew nothing of cerebrums or cerebellums,
or of chords,—Lost or Found,—so how
was he to know that Jack was making a goose of
him? That night, after he had sought his down
pillows to sleep, the erratic spirit refused to close
his eyes. Then Algy began to wonder what that
tremendously wise chap meant by his high-toned
airs! How the girls would have teased Jack, had
they but known that Algy revered the young man’s
intelligence—all because that joker spoke of matters
pertaining to the head.</p>

<p>Early the following morning Jack rapped upon
each door of the rooms occupied by his friends,
and informed them that he was ready to start on
that day’s excursion. There was no need for a
second call for breakfast that time—in less than
half an hour every one was gathered about the
table. True, Algy looked heavy-eyed, but no one
paid overmuch attention to him.</p>

<p>“We are going to take lunch and eat it in the
Ceremonial Cave at Frigoles Canyon, this noon,”
announced Jack. “If we take one of the autos
usually rented for the round trip, we are limited
to six passengers. That would cost us thirty-five
dollars for the sixty-eight miles there and back.
If we wanted to remain overnight at El Rito
Ranch, the extra cost on the car would be twenty
dollars. So I got busy and figured out costs, and
I am persuaded to hire a regular seven-passenger
automobile, such as we had yesterday, and go as
we like, and return any old time. What do you
think of the suggestion?”</p>

<p>The car used the preceding day was very comfortable;
and the idea of leaving one member out
of the party if the regular bus was engaged had
no appeal to any one in Jack’s party; hence it was
quickly decided to engage the large touring car
for the round trip—perhaps for the night and
next day. Immediately after deciding this question,
Jack hastened out of the dining-room and arranged
for the auto.</p>

<p>The hotel management packed a generous
luncheon for seven guests and the chauffeur, and
soon after breakfast had been finished the young
folks gathered on the verandah for the start.</p>

<p>Jack sat in front beside the driver and learned
much about the wonders of the region. It was
due to information thus received that he halted
the car some time after Santa Fé had been left
behind, and told his companions about the ranch
called El Rito where a splendid luncheon was to
be had at a dollar a person.</p>

<p>“But we have planned a luncheon in the cave
you told about, Jack!” exclaimed Eleanor, plainly
disappointed.</p>

<p>“The driver says we will be so hungry by three
o’clock, that an extra lunch will be found most acceptable.
That’s what I thought we would do
with the hamper of good things,” explained Jack.</p>

<p>“In that case, we will have no appetite for dinner
to-night, and later, about nine o’clock every
one will feel starved,” objected Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>“The driver says it is a most tiresome trip to
make in one day, because we will want to climb
and visit all the queer caves and ruins, and we’ll
be thankful for a rest at the ranch to-night. We
can get excellent rooms at this time of year for
three to three-fifty per. I thought his suggestion
an improvement on my plan. Then we might enjoy
the ride back to-morrow, early in the morning,
far more than coming in late at night all
tired and hungry after such a day’s outing.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jack! We’ll do as you say. But
tell the driver to be sure and see that we get good
accommodations at the ranch,” agreed Mrs.
Courtney, having been informed that the others
were pleased with the change of programme.</p>

<p>The entire country presented interesting as
well as unexpected scenery, and the girls were
too absorbed in gazing around to pay attention to
Mrs. Alexander and Algy. These two members
of the group never saw anything novel or unique
in the sights passed. Had they been suddenly
perched upon the top-most pinnacle of the Continental
Divide they would not have felt the exaltation
of soul which would have caused others to
groan with the burden of a physical body that
held the spirit down upon earth!</p>

<p>Picturesque Mexican villages with adobe
houses and old mission churches gave Polly and
Eleanor ample opportunities for kodak pictures.
The dark-eyed señoritas and their adoring señoras
added the touch of Ancient Spain to the views.
In direct opposition to these old Spanish scenes,
was the grandeur of sheer cliffs and mighty
canyons, the road often winding along the very
edge of great boulders which might roll and hurl
them all down into dreaded depths. While skirting
these awesome chasms Mrs. Alexander uttered
shrill little screams and clung dependently
to Algy’s arm. Poor fellow! He wished he had
some strong right arm upon which he, too, might
lean during those risky places.</p>

<p>After stopping at El Rito Ranch for an excellent
dinner, and having engaged the best rooms
to be had for that night, the party went on its way
rejoicing.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was spent in visiting the
ruins in Frigole Canyon, getting pictures of different
views of the ancient Kiva in Ceremonial
Cave of the Canyon, and in adventuring to various
old cave dwellings.</p>

<p>It was well that Jack had planned for his party
to remain over-night at El Rito Ranch, because
there was scant time before sunset that evening
to see all the wonders of this remarkable place.
They wished to visit White Rock Canyon and the
Painted Cave, but the darkness fell too quickly
for further sight-seeing. Therefore it was voted
unanimously to return and see all that was left to
see the next morning.</p>

<p>The evening at the ranch house passed merrily
for the young people. The victrola provided the
dance music, and the younger members in the
party were the dancers. But the day had been
fatiguing in spite of the enjoyment of the sights
seen, so bed was not sneered at when Mrs. Courtney
suggested sleep.</p>

<p>After a hearty breakfast in the early morning,
Jack superintended the activities of packing another
luncheon and placing his friends for the
drive to the Cave and Canyon.</p>

<p>Upon this trip Algy managed to place Dodo
between her mother and himself. He had rebelled
at the demonstration of trust and dependence
shown by Mrs. Alexander the previous day,
not that he felt annoyed at the good judgment
of his elderly friend, but because he wished to be
absolutely free to save himself in case another
dangerous route had to be taken in reaching the
Cave that day. What could he do for himself if
a heavy woman clung tenaciously to his arm?</p>

<p>But Algy had maneuvered in vain, that time,
since the auto road ran safely over splendid tableland
until the Canyon was reached. Here the
driver advised his passengers to get out and walk
to the Cave and other points of interest, in order
that they might see all the various things along
the way.</p>

<p>The Painted Cave was left for the last visit.
And just before “doing” that, Jack proposed
luncheon on the edge of the great cliffs along the
Rio Grande. The girls hailed the idea, but Algy
had nothing to say. In fact, when the others sat
as close to the edge of the towering cliff as it was
possible to reach in safety, he managed to sit the
farthest back in the group. At every shout of
sudden or unexpected laughter from the others in
the happy party, had any one watched the timorous
youth he might have been seen to jump nervously
and turn pale.</p>

<p>Then they all proceeded to the Painted Cave;
Algy, naturally, lingering behind the others as
though he wished to study each strange item seen
on the way. Finally the others had advanced so
far ahead of the loiterer that they were quite out
of sight. This was the timid young man’s opportunity
to enter an aperture and silently await the
return of his friends. Then he could slip out unseen
and join them as they returned to the entrance
of the Cave. His plan would have worked
wonderfully well for him, had not Jack studied
the sketch given him that morning by the host of
El Rito Ranch. By this map it was found that an
exit could be used by going single file through a
crevice at the end of the Cave, and emerging
some distance away from the main entrance.</p>

<p>The sense of adventure proved a factor in the
general approval to follow this exit, so Jack led
on and used his pocket flash-light to show the way.
The others followed directly after him, and no
one dreamed that Algy was not one of the party
in the Cave where unusual sights abounded.
Each one had been intent upon seeing all that was
possible, hence Algy had been forgotten for the
time being.</p>

<p>Finally Jack led them out once more to the dry,
clear, invigorating air, and then they picked a
careful pathway around the cliff to get back to
their rendezvous with the chauffeur. Not till
then did they realize that one of the party was
missing.</p>

<p>“Why—good gracious me! Where did he
go?” exclaimed Polly.</p>

<p>“When did you see him last?” asked Jack,
wonderingly, as he turned and gazed along the
trail to the Cave.</p>

<p>“Really—I can’t say,” admitted Dodo; and
Mrs. Alexander also confessed that she had not
missed her usual escort.</p>

<p>“Could he have fallen down one of the slippery
sides of the rocky way we came out?” asked Mrs.
Courtney, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Hardly! The trail is too carefully guarded
against accident,” returned Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, we can’t go on without him.
We’ve got to hunt him up now,” declared Dodo,
impatiently. Then she added, to her mother,
“Why don’t you tie him to your apron-strings,
since he is not capable of taking care of himself?”</p>

<p>“You don’t expect me to sacrifice my pleasure
by playing nurse maid to your admirer, do you?”
retorted Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>“You know very well that he never would have
joined this party were it not that you insisted that
he come. He knows I despise his airs and silly
attentions, but you keep encouraging him. So it’s
up to you to assume responsibility for his safety.
He cannot take care of himself, as you can see.”</p>

<p>Thus arguing over the hapless Algy, the two
arguers followed Jack back to the Painted Cave.
But so much time had been devoted to other sights
that day, that now it was twilight once more and
the Cave entrance was shrouded in semi-darkness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile what had become of the lost Algy?</p>

<p>He found the small cave he had entered quite a
pleasant hiding-place. And, seeing a soft covering
of dried grass and roots upon the rock at one
side, he decided to sit down and rest, while waiting to catch the sound of the voices of his returning
friends.</p>

<p>He sat thus for some time, but he preferred doing
nothing, even though he had to sit in a low,
rock-ribbed cavelet while doing so. He felt
drowsy, and he was tired from the long tramps of
the day before, plus the constant walking while
exploring the places where he saw nothing to rave
over—as the girls seemed to do.</p>

<p>As he waited patiently, with now and then a
little doze to furnish necessary stimulus to his
weary body, he was suddenly roused by a horrid
noise at the mouth of his retreat. He had penetrated
so far into the small aperture as was possible,
and he had no idea of what the threatening
danger might be, but he did understand that without
notice or explanation the place he was in became
unexpectedly dark.</p>

<p>He jumped up and ran back to the opening of
the crevice and, there, to his horror, he found that
a huge boulder had rolled down and now filled the
entrance and exit of his hiding-place. It was indeed
a hiding-place now!</p>

<p>Algy’s head went round dizzily, and he felt
that he would swoon, only he managed to recollect,
too, that he dared not give in to unconsciousness then, lest his friends pass by during that time
and he would be helpless to shout to them to help
free him.</p>

<p>Fear and desperation acted like spurs to his
usual lack of physical control, and he felt relieved
to learn that the fainting spell was passing away.
Then he examined the rock in order to see if it
might have left a crevice wide enough for his slim
form to pass through. But no!</p>

<p>He drew in his breath and cramped his almost
flat body against the rough sides of the senseless
boulder, and he tore his natty clothes to shreds
upon the jagged edges of the heartless obstruction.
Then he sat down and began to cry childishly,
complaining to the silence of the dark cave the
reasons he had for cursing such an outlandish trip—but
he did not dare to use any strong language
in his extremity, because he was not certain
whether it would send him to limbo or not.
Hence he remained neutral by merely giving utterance
to what he <i>wished</i> to do under these trying
circumstances. Even in this predicament,
Algy felt that he might be overheard by cultured
persons, and he flattered himself that he was acting
up to the nicest form of politeness.</p>

<p>Loneliness and dark solitude are not conducive
to polite behavior, however, as Algy learned after
he had been captive in the small cavelet for some
time; still no one passed by on the other side of
that naughty rock!</p>

<p>“I’d blast you to atoms with my vengeance, if
I had the means!” shouted Algy, to the insensible
fragment of cliff before him.</p>

<p>Then he ran up and began pounding it with his
doubled fists; but these futile taps merely
scratched his flesh and bruised his knuckles, so he
desisted and retired again.</p>

<p>After a few minutes,—seemingly hours to the
frantic young stowaway,—he ran up to the rock
again and strove mightily to shove it ever so little
out of its bed, in order to allow him a bit more
space by which he might manage to squeeze past,
but the stubborn obstacle had no intention of giving
way—even ever so little.</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean, nasty, old thing!” screamed
Algy, striking at the sharp face of the boulder
again and again. “If I was out of here I’d blow
you to bits with a ton of dynamite, so there!”
Then he sat down upon the hard rock-floor and
began to weep helplessly.</p>

<p>“Why was I ever beguiled into coming to this
awful country, where there is no pleasure or peace
for a highly cultured young man? Oh, why do I
love Dodo Alexander as I do, when I’d rather be
heart-free to go about with my friends at Colorado
Springs, instead of having a slow death in
this cave?”</p>

<p>As he reached the end of his lamentations, he,
like Job, lifted up his voice to the high heavens
and his wail ended in a yell of fear. It was well
he did so, since that ear-splitting yell reached the
leader of the rescue party—no other than Jack!</p>

<p>“Now you-all stay out here where it is light,
and I’ll go in and show A. A. A. the way out.
Seeing they have no exits printed upon the walls
of the Painted Cave, it is no wonder he lost his
way.”</p>

<p>Thus saying, Jack ran into the Cave and came
opposite the place where Algy sat Indian fashion
upon the ground, his nose lifted up in the air
after the manner of a hound when he bays at
night.</p>

<p>“Say, A. A. A.! Stop that nerve-racking
howl, will you?” called Jack, locating him by his
cries.</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack! Is that you, dearest boy? Help
me out of this death, and I’ll never forget you,”
shouted Algy, in a frenzy of hope.</p>

<p>“I’ll get you out, if I can, without your everlasting
remembrance,” laughed Jack, going over
to try to push the boulder aside. But he found it
would not budge an inch.</p>

<p>“Say! why don’t you come out the same way
you went in?” asked Jack, finally.</p>

<p>“I cawn’t, you know! I came in, and that
blawsted rock rolled down and blocked the way.
Do push it away, won’t you, precious Jack.”</p>

<p>“Say, there! stop calling me names, will you?
I’ll go right home, and never play with you again,
if you dub me one of those mushy things again,”
growled Jack, glaring at the rock fiercely, as
though it were Algy.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes! I’ll agree to anything, Jack
de—only get me out safely, at once,” whimpered
Algy.</p>

<p>Jack tried again to move the boulder, ever so
little, but it seemed to be wedged tight, and he
realized that he must get assistance.</p>

<p>“A. A. A., I’ve got to go back to the car and
get the chauffeur to come and help. Also, we
must have a crow-bar, or a length of tree, to pry
under the stone and move it. You sit down and
play tag with your fingers, while I am gone for
help.” Without waiting for Algy’s mournful reply to stay nearby with him and not leave him
alone in the dark, Jack rushed away and was soon
out of the cave.</p>

<p>A few words shouted to the girls explained
where he was going, and then he was out of sight.</p>

<p>Well, between the driver of the car, a broad-shouldered
Amazon of a westerner, and Jack, the
dandified New Yorker, and a stout trunk of a tree
which had been found and dragged to the cave
niche where A. A. A. still wept and wailed for
succor, the rock was moved enough to enable
Algy to come through the aperture made for
him.</p>

<p>But, oh! what a sight he made, when he appeared
in the light of the flash-lamp. Jack doubled
over with laughing, and the driver hastily
glanced back to assure himself that the ladies
were not able to see the scarcely covered form of
thin little Algernon.</p>

<p>“Here! throw this dust-coat about you, Mister,
and button it all the way down, or the girls will
jump into the Canyon,” roared the heartless
chauffeur, as he offered this protection to A. A. A.</p>

</h2>

<p>Upon arriving at the hotel in Albuquerque,
Jack was given a letter written by Mr. Dalken
that same morning. In it he explained that Mr.
Alexander, Mr. Fuzzier and he had to go on to
Gallup in order to confer with several other gentlemen
who would be in that place for a few days.
Jack was told to conduct his friends to such points
of interest as they might wish to see, and to come
on to Gallup not later than three days from date.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Jack, waving the paper at
the girls, as they waited for him in one of the
beautiful alcoves of the hotel, “We have <i>carte
blanche</i> to do whatever we please for the next
three days. Dalky has to be in Gallup, where we
will meet him when we leave here.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” returned Polly, regretfully, “I was sure
we would have him with us on our tours in Albuquerque.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with me—any complaints
about my manner of playing host?” demanded
Jack.</p>

<p>“No, but that’s just it, Jacky,” laughed Eleanor.
“You only <i>play</i> host, while Dalky is the real
thing.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” snorted Jack, then he turned away
to Dodo. “I see you disagree with the others—and
it’s just as well that you do, or I would resign,
and take up my valet duties again.”</p>

<p>The girls smiled, but Algy had not heard of
Jack’s engagement as a valet, so he was horrified
at what he just heard.</p>

<p>“Valet! Valet! Wh-y,—I was told by Mrs.
Alexander that you were quite my equal in society.
She never mentioned the fact that you had
been a common servant,” gasped Algy, horrified
at the disclosure.</p>

<p>“Oh! didn’t you,” was Jack’s delighted reply.
“Perhaps Mrs. Alex. never knew it herself, or
I’m sure she never would have associated with me
so intimately.” Then Jack sighed heavily and
added, to the girls’ intense amusement, “I have
had a hard life of it—till Mr. Dalken took an interest
in my future career and offered me the
position of valet to himself. You can imagine
how I jumped at such a chance—having been a
waif thrown upon the mercies of a cold world all
those years!”</p>

<p>“You don’t say!” was all Algy could whisper
in his distress at hearing such astounding revelations
from a young man whom he had fondly believed
to be a millionaire. What a shock to his
sensitive self!</p>

<p>“You will pawdon me, I’m suah, Mr. Baxter,
but I—ah—feel that I must attend to an urgent
errand,” stammered the troubled youth.</p>

<p>“Certainly! Certainly!” agreed Jack, grinning
broadly as Algy hurriedly left the group to seek
out Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>“Oh! That’s the best joke yet!” laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“The little snob!” muttered Dodo, angrily.
“Now he’ll act so superior to Jack that life will
be made wretched.”</p>

<p>“It will be the best fun I ever had, Dodo, and
I don’t want you to spoil it by telling the child the
truth about me,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to warn Dalky and Mrs. Courtney
then, or they’ll wonder what’s wrong with
A. A. A.,” added Polly.</p>

<p>“You tell Mrs. Courtney, and I’ll put Dalky
and Dodo’s father on,” laughed Jack, gleefully.</p>

<p>Before the plotters had had time to plan for
their next diversion, the hotel porter came over
to Jack and asked politely: “I am holding a number
of trunks for your party, sir, and I shall be
glad to deliver them to the rooms you direct me
to.”</p>

<p>“Trunks! Why, we brought our light luggage
with us,” exclaimed Jack, astonished.</p>

<p>“These were forwarded from the Spring Hotel
at Colorado Springs, and they are plainly directed
to Mrs. Alexander, care Dalken Party, Alvarado
Hotel, Albuquerque,” explained the porter.</p>

<p>“Goodness me! They are <i>mother’s</i> trunks!”
cried Dodo, with intense annoyance. “I warned
her not to send her trunks, because we would have
no need for elaborate clothes. She promised me
she would have the hotel management store them
for her till further notice. Now what does she
mean?”</p>

<p>It was soon explained, because Mrs. Alexander
now joined the surprised circle of young friends
and used her loftiest manner in addressing the
porter and Jack.</p>

<p>“Young man (to Jack), show the porter to my
room, and help him unstrap the trunks.” She
held forth the key to her room as she spoke.</p>

<p>Dodo was about to exclaim, but Jack sent her
a look, and the other two girls nudged her quickly
to keep her quiet. Jack took the proffered key,
and nodded to the staring porter to follow him.</p>

<p>“I got ’em on the freight elevator, sir. We
got to go up that way,” announced the porter,
apologetically.</p>

<p>“Quite right, porter,” retorted Mrs. Alexander.
“All servants should be made to use other
elevators than those their masters use.”</p>

<p>“Mother!” exclaimed Dodo, frowning at such
airs, but Jack bowed humbly and followed the
porter.</p>

<p>“Don’t you ever look at me, or speak to me in
such a shocked manner again, Dorothy, when I
am addressing servants. If there is any reason left
in this world of silly democracy since the War,
I’m going to find it, and I shall act as though I
understood the rights of Class. If you prefer to
follow with the rabble along with your father,
do so.”</p>

<p>Dodo turned away in anger, but she did not reply
as usual to her mother’s irritating remarks.
Then Mrs. Alexander hurried away also, leaving
Polly and Eleanor alone to discuss the peculiar
situation.</p>

<p>When Jack got back to the hotel lobby no one
he knew was to be seen, and he rightly decided
that all had gone to their rooms. Then he
strolled over to the desk and began to chat with
the clerk. When he left him again, the clerk was
seen to be smiling appreciatively at a joke.</p>

<p>That day was spent in seeing the sights of Albuquerque,
and arrangements were made for a
motor trip to Isleta, Laguna and Acoma, including
the Enchanted Mesa. Jack had engaged a
seven-passenger car as usual, which would carry
the entire party, but Mrs. Alexander and Algy
refused to go. Dodo looked furious after she
had asked her mother privately for her reasons
in not being one of the group, and the other girls
and Jack had no trouble in guessing the cause—why
two members of their group dropped out of
the sight-seeing. Jack smiled.</p>

<p>The five remaining members of the outing
party enjoyed the day as much as though Algy
and Mrs. Alexander had been with them, and it
must be confessed that the ride was far more
enjoyable with but five in the car, which made it
possible for Jack to be with his friends, instead of
sitting outside beside the driver.</p>

<p>Isleta and the Ruins were visited that day, but
Laguna and Acoma were left for the following
day. This change of plan was agreed upon after
Jack was told by the chauffeur of the mid-week
dance to be given at the hotel that night. Immediately,
the young folks voted to go back in time
to rest and be ready for the hop.</p>

<p>Dinner was speedily disposed of, and then the
girls hurried to their rooms to dress in the simple
evening frocks which they had packed in their
light luggage. Polly and Eleanor were soon
ready, and then they ran to Dodo’s room to help
her if necessary. A few minutes after they were
comfortably seated and watching Dodo slip her
feet into silver brocade slippers, a sharp rap
sounded upon the door.</p>

<p>“That’s Ma’s knock,” whispered Dodo, going
to unlock the door. She was right. Mrs. Alexander
entered the room with a gorgeous frock
over her arm.</p>

<p>“I brought your dress for this evening, Dodo,”
she said, dropping it upon the bed. Then she
sneered at the simple gown her daughter wore.
“You don’t mean to say that you’d be seen in this
exclusive hotel in that rag!”</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor wore similar unpretentious
dresses and they wondered what Mrs. Alexander
would think of their costumes! Dodo was not to
be so easily influenced as once she had been long
ago, while on that European tour. She had developed
a great deal of independence since that
time, and she had scant patience with her
mother’s whims.</p>

<p>“This is not a personal affair, Ma, nor is it expected
that transient guests dress like all-possessed.
You’d look a hundred per cent more exclusive,
and appear in better taste, if you’d remove
that imported Paris gown and all your diamonds,
and wear a simpler rig,” advised Dodo, her expression
plainly condemning her mother’s tendency
to display her finery.</p>

<p>“When one has jewels and clothes like mine,
it is foolish to keep them in the trunks. How is
the world to know we have these things, unless
we show them?” demanded Mrs. Alexander,
angrily.</p>

<p>“There are places where it is correct to wear
them, and there are people who know enough to
keep them for proper occasions; but you’ll find
such society members do not consider this sort of
an impromptu hop the place to show off personal
effects.”</p>

<p>“Humph! I suppose you are throwing Mrs.
Courtney up to me, by speaking of society persons
who know how to dress! Well, I will say
this much: I wouldn’t <i>think</i> of traveling in such
a dowdy tailormade suit as she wears on this trip.
Not a speck of trimming on it, and no panels or
drape to conform to the very latest fashion. Her
ball-gown most likely will be similar to her convent-like
taste in dressing,” declared Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>Eleanor flared up in defence of her friend’s
perfect judgment in dressing. “If you knew
the price of that exclusive tailormade suit imported
direct from London a few weeks ago, and
showing next season’s advanced styles, you’d
change your mind, Mrs. Alex.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Alex. had no opportunity to change
her mind at that moment, since a knock sounded
upon the door, and Dodo opened it to admit the
lady just being discussed. The moment the girls
saw Mrs. Courtney, they felt secretly delighted.
She wore a handsome though strictly suitable
black velvet gown relieved only by a long string of
beautiful pearls about her neck. In contrast to
the flashily gowned Mrs. Alexander, there could
be no doubt as to the good taste of the one dressed
in simple black.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander must have felt the silent rebuke
of the other lady’s quiet appearance, for
she tossed her extravagantly coiffured head and
marched to the half-open door. There she turned
and said: “I expect you to wear that dress I
brought in, Dodo,” then she was gone.</p>

<p>“Ma may expect it of me, but she is doomed
to disappointment, this time,” remarked Dodo,
giving the dress a disgusted look.</p>

<p>“If you are ready, girls, we may as well go
down to the dance,” suggested Mrs. Courtney,
wondering what had caused the suppressed anger
so plainly manifested on the faces of the three
girls.</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried Eleanor, jumping up quickly;
“let’s get out of here before we explode.”</p>

<p>Grasping Dodo by the hand, she dragged her
towards the door. Polly, laughing, followed with
Mrs. Courtney. They descended and upon arriving
at the ball-room where the mid-week hop
was held, they found Jack waiting for them.</p>

<p>“The poor valet has to ask some fair lady to
befriend him, because A. A. A. and his patroness
just sailed past me without a glance. Even a lapdog
may be given a kindly look or a bonbon,”
complained Jack.</p>

<p>“You do not seem to be downcast over your
treatment,” giggled Dodo. “But come along—I’ll
take you under my wing and introduce you to
the Honorable Algy and my Ma.”</p>

<p>“Better not! Ma may send you to bed,”
warned Eleanor. “Or more dreadful still, Algy
may never be seen in your company again, if you
persist in associating with a mere valet.”</p>

<p>“S-s-h! Girls, remember Mrs. Alexander is
Dodo’s mother, and as such she is entitled to your
respect,” was Mrs. Courtney’s rebuke.</p>

<p>There were many dancers on the floor when
Polly and her friends were ready to join them,
and the sight of pretty gowns and still prettier
faces presented a festive scene. Since there was
but one man in their party, the girls urged Jack
to take Dodo for the first dance—in spite of Mrs.
Courtney’s shake of the head. And off Dodo and
Jack danced.</p>

<p>At first glance nothing was seen of Mrs. Alexander
and Algy; soon, however, they were seen
whirling swiftly around in the dance, drawing
nearer and nearer to Dodo and the despised
“valet”—both of whom danced slowly and gracefully.
The other two girls and their chaperon
watched the two couples eagerly.</p>

<p>Algy seemed to think that speed in dancing
proved he was a past master in the art, so he,
metaphorically speaking, “stepped on the gas” at
every other round, gathering momentum as he
whirled. Naturally his partner had to keep step
with him or give up the race. But Mrs. Alexander
was not the woman to give up a dancing
partner, even though that partner flew around
like a mad kitten after a ball of wool.</p>

<p>As might have been foreseen by the watchers
of this comedy, Algy and his partner, in blindly
wheeling fast and furiously, collided with Dodo
and Jack, who were chatting and enjoying the
rhythm of the music and the motion of the sliding
steps.</p>

<p>Jack seemed slender in black evening clothes,
but he was a splendid athlete, and his body was
hard as nails. Thus, when the soft pulpy form
of Mrs. Alexander struck him back to back, it
was not Jack who grunted and fell over.</p>

<p>Algy, being a “fragile darling,” and never prepared
for emergencies, was lifted from his feet
when Mrs. Alexander began to slip and gyrate,
while endeavoring to balance in an upright position.
The grip the lady maintained upon the only
tangible thing at hand made Algy hop-skip-and-jump
about like a Jack-on-a-stick. But all this
performing took only a few moments to accomplish,
then came the end—upon the floor.</p>

<p>For such a little fellow Algy needed more room
in sprawling than three big men could have covered.
Consequently he managed to trip several
other couples who could not avoid dancing close
to the danger zone, and they, too, began to slip
and slide about grotesquely before they subsided
upon the floor.</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor, try as they would, could not
help laughing at the amusing scene; and others in
every direction joined in the general laugh. The
music now came to an abrupt end, leaving the embarrassed
group of unfortunates the center of attraction.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander, much too stout for her elaborate
gown, had paid the room-maid handsomely
to strap her into her harness. Then she found it
possible to work herself into the tight-fitting costume.
She had had difficulty in breathing, however,
and soon after Algy began to whirl her
giddily around the floor, she wished with all her
heart that she had had courage to refuse to dance.
But she had heard that dancing made people slender and sylphlike, so she had succumbed to the
temptation.</p>

<p>After turning about like a whirligig, Mrs.
Alexander had appreciated why dancing made one
thin—she was perspiring freely and had no opportunity
in which to dry her streaming face.
Her breath had become shorter and shorter, and
her head seemed to swim. At the last she felt
that she must drop or die, but instead, had come
the collision.</p>

<p>Now she doubled up on the smooth floor, gasping
madly for a bit of air. The more she struggled
to gain a foothold on the waxed wood, the
more she slid and gasped. Finally a desperately
deep breath broke the bonds which held her lungs
and heart as in a vise, and instantly there sounded
the r-r-r-ip of a tight seam.</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed the wearer of the armor, as she
released her pent-up lungs and thought she would
fly from sheer lightness. Then she recollected
where she was. This reminded her that she must
divert the laughter from herself to others, so she
instantly pretended to faint—to rouse sympathy
in place of ridicule. And she was an adept at
fainting.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say! Mah deah Mrs. Alex.! Do try
to sit up,” cried Algy, plaintively, when he saw
her head roll back and her eyes close.</p>

<p>But his partner seemingly was dead to his supplications.
He managed to stand up, and then
he gazed helplessly around for some one to come
and advise him what to do. His eyes, in their
roving, found the despised valet watching him
with ill-concealed amusement.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say theah! Come heah, and lift this
lady from the floah.” But Jack turned and gave
his attention to the girls. Mrs. Courtney seemed
to be urging them to do something against which
they rebelled.</p>

<p>Algy felt angry at a common valet’s treatment
of him, and now he cried aloud shrilly: “I say!
Mr. Dalken’s valet—you, Baxtah! Come heah
directly, and lift this lady to a chaih!”</p>

<p>Several men sprang over at the call, believing
the poor woman to be injured; and finally Dodo
had to go with Mrs. Courtney to see that her
mother was not hurt. Dodo had declared the
truth—that she knew her mother too well to fear
that anything worse than chagrin could be the
matter with her.</p>

<p>Even while Mrs. Alexander was planning what
to do, should they try to carry her to an alcove
to revive, an unexpected turn was given events,
by the presence of a physician. He kneeled upon
the floor beside the prostrate woman and took
her wrist between his practised fingers. As he
counted the strong, regular beats, he began to
smile.</p>

<p>Evidently the doctor had no patience with
women who played upon the sympathy of their
friends. He must have seen other cases similar to
Mrs. Alexander’s, because he applied a drastic
remedy.</p>

<p>“Here, gentlemen—lend me a pocket-knife,
will you? I must slash this gown up and down to
give the patient plenty of room to breathe. And
you, my good woman, remove her jeweled dog-collar
so her neck muscles can act. Hold it till
she revives—it’s only paste, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The very idea of slashing that wonderful gown
was bad enough to bring consciousness back to a
dying woman, but add to that the awful fact that
a ten-thousand-dollar collar would be handled
as though the stones were paste, was too much!
Suddenly Mrs. Alexander sat up!</p>

<p>She forgot to regain consciousness slowly and
gracefully, but she remembered the heartless doctor’s
words—only paste!</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare ruin my gown!” cried she,
catching hold of the hand that would devastate a
Parisian model. “As for my diamonds being
paste! Well, I can show you the insurance on
them. Paste, indeed!”</p>

<p>With this retort, Mrs. Alexander managed to
stand on her feet, though it was not done without
awkwardness.</p>

<p>“There!” muttered Dodo, flushing scarlet,
“Didn’t I tell you so?” And the poor girl turned
away quickly and hurried from the room. Mrs.
Courtney followed immediately, beckoning Polly
and Eleanor to come, too.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>JACK’S VALET DUTIES</span>
</h2>

<p>After a full realization of what must be the
general opinion of Mrs. Alexander in the hotel,
every one in the Dalken party felt eager to get
away from Albuquerque. Hence, the morning
following the hop and its disastrous result for
Dodo’s mother, the tourists left for Gallup.</p>

<p>They had not thought of telegraphing to Mr.
Dalken of their changed plans, but Jack had been
thoughtful enough to wire the hotel management
to reserve several of their best suites for his party.
Thus they found everything in readiness for them,
but Mr. Dalken was out with his two associates,
Mr. Alexander and Mr. Fuzzier. Jack thought
the hotel manager would tell Mr. Dalken that his
friends were due to arrive that day, but the manager,
not knowing that the signed name of “John
Baxter,” upon the telegram meant anything to his
star guest never mentioned it.</p>

<p>Consequently there was a great surprise awaiting Mr. Alexander and Mr. Dalken that evening
when they came back to their hotel: an unpleasant
surprise for the little miner-millionaire, and
a pleasant one for the New York millionaire.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon, Dalken! Ain’t
that my wife sittin’ over there with that silver-headed
dude?” whispered Mr. Alexander, as he
caught a glimpse of a gorgeously gowned woman
conversing eagerly with the great and only
A. A. A.</p>

<p>“Why—yes,” responded Mr. Dalken, as he
caught hold of his companion’s arm, to prevent
him from getting away again—little Mr. Alexander’s
instinct of self-preservation was as strong
now as ever it had been in the dangers and risks
of a gold-miner’s claims and work.</p>

<p>“Come with me to the register and see if our
entire party is here. No one will see you, if you
walk in front of me, you know,” advised Mr.
Dalken.</p>

<p>That seemed to calm Mr. Alexander’s perturbed
mind, and he managed to keep well out of
sight of his wife as he walked over to the desk.
The register showed the names of all the members
of the New York party, plus the names of
Dodo and her mother, plus a name which filled
the whole line—“Honorable Algernon Alfred
Alveston, London, England.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” jeered Mr. Alexander. “Now he’s
takin’ to callin’ himself an honorable! Wonder
if he really comes from London, England, or
London, Connecticut?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken laughed at the sarcastic look in his
friend’s eyes, and he added: “There’s a London
in Canada, too, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yeh, I s’pose so!” muttered Mr. Alexander.
“Mebbe, afore I get through with A. A. A. he’ll
be fixin’ to run away to London, Canada!”</p>

<p>“My dear friend, don’t waste your ire on him,”
advised Mr. Dalken. “He’s perfectly harmless,
and he keeps your wife engaged in pleasant entertainments.
Remember, that allows you more
freedom to seek after your own interests.”</p>

<p>“Well, I ain’t so sure about his bein’ harmless!”
retorted Mr. Alexander. “He’s after
Dodo, you see, and I won’t stand for any monkeyshines
in that direction—not even if the Missus
swears A. A. A. can pay court to my gal. Dodo
is more like me, and she ain’t got use for no
prancin’ little scatter-brain like him.”</p>

<p>Having aired his grievance, Mr. Alexander felt
better, and Mr. Dalken had no difficulty in persuading him to use the stairway discovered in the
corridor outside the smoking room. Thus they
would not need to cross the lobby, where Mrs.
Alexander and Algy might see any one who came
in or went out.</p>

<p>Polly and her friends learned, that night, that
Mr. Dalken would have to remain in Gallup for
about a week, so this would give the tourists
ample time in which to visit such points of interest
as Zuñi, Inscription Rock (which is now a National
Monument), the Mormon settlement of
Ramah, and other sights. Being November, Jack
learned that the famous Shalako dance of the
Zuñi Indians was to be held that week. Since this
is the most interesting of all the amazing Zuñi
celebrations, the girls were delighted to find they
would be able to see it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had been silenced by her
fiasco at the hotel hop in Albuquerque, and its effects
had made her show more friendliness towards
Jack, but she still thought that he should
be made to fetch and carry for Mr. Dalken’s
companions, so she felt no compunction in asking
him to do errands for her.</p>

<p>This arrogance of his revered friend seemed to
be contagious for Algy, and he had no hesitancy
in asking Jack to get things for him, or to go to
learn what the girls wished to do that day. Naturally
Jack refused to dance attendance upon
the unpopular young man, and Mrs. Alexander
called this “insubordination on the part of a servant.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you complain to Mr. Dalken,”
asked Dodo one day, after hearing her mother
complain about “that valet.”</p>

<p>“I would, in a minute, if the man were your
father’s valet. Being Mr. Dalken’s man-servant,
however, I’m not sure whether we ought to ask
favors of him,” admitted Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>Dodo laughed. “Well, you might tell Dad
about him, and get Dad to complain to Mr. Dalken.”</p>

<p>“That’s a fine idea, Dodo! I’ll do it the minute
I see your father again,” declared Mrs. Alexander,
a satisfied expression of retaliation settling
upon her face.</p>

<p>Algy was seen approaching at this moment, so
Dodo hastened away to tell Jack and her friends
about her mother’s decision. But Mrs. Alexander
confided in Algy that now she had a way to make
that insolent valet mind his business! Thereupon
she told Algy what she purposed doing, the next
time Jack showed any inclination to balk at work
or duty.</p>

<p>“I shall remembah this, deah Mrs. Alex., the
next time I have occasion to use the fellah, and
he sneers me out of countenance,” added Algy, a
gleam of malice flitting over his expressionless
face.</p>

<p>The entire group of tourists were gathered in
the Lounge that evening, when Jack spoke of his
plans for the week they would remain in Gallup.
“I made a rough sketch of Gallup and various
points of interest that we ought to see. But I
figured out that it would be waste of time to
motor half-way across Arizona to visit the Hopi
Indian Reservation, and the wonderful sights
near the Grand Canyon. Those can be seen when
we stop at Flagstaff, with Dalky.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney and Mr. Dalken merely nodded
their heads in agreement with Jack’s suggestions.
But Mrs. Alexander failed to see the nods, and
thought this a splendid opportunity to set Algy
against Jack. Therefore she whispered eagerly
to her ever-present shadow, A. A. A., and he
seemed spurred to action.</p>

<p>“Aw, I say, Mistah Dalken, it seems rawtheh
impertinent, don’chaw know, for a meah servant
to dictate to us like this,” began Algy, pulling
fiercely at the few lonesome white hairs upon his
upper lip.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken turned and glanced at Algy in surprise.
He had not been informed that Jack was
rigging this “darling of the gods.” He heartily
disapproved of A. A. A.’s standards and behavior,
and now he felt slightly annoyed at what
he said.</p>

<p>Algy thought the New York financier showed
concern over the situation—a situation made impossible
by having a man-servant sit in such intimate
relations with his master and his master’s
friends. Fully convinced that he was doing the
gallant deed for all the ladies who did not wish
to hurt Mr. Dalken’s feelings, Algy summoned
courage and continued his complaint.</p>

<p>“Theah may be places we would like to visit,
places quite incomprehensible to ordinary minds
such as servants have. Theahfoh, we would awsk
that the man Baxter be relieved of duties foh
which he is not mentally equipped.” As Algy
concluded, he bowed very deferentially to Mr.
Dalken.</p>

<p>“What the blazes is that poor dote drivin’ at?”
demanded Mr. Alexander, scowling at Algy, but
speaking to his wife.</p>

<p>“S-sh! Don’t interfere!” commanded his wife,
sternly.</p>

<p>“I won’t ‘s-s-sh’ at such an insult,” rebelled
Mr. Alexander. “And what’s more, if that Barnum’s
Freak wants to toddle by your side during
this trip to Arizony, he’s got’ta watch his step!
We ain’t got time ner room for him to hold up
any game, lemme tell you-all, and there ain’t no
call fer him to have any opinions ‘bout nawthin’—not
even Jack Baxter!” As Mr. Alexander relieved
his mind of the weight of grievance, he
was surprised to hear Jack laugh outright, and
he saw several of the others smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy! You made the most awful break
just now. You told A. A. A. he had no right to
any opinions about nothing—not even Jack’ and
I’m sure Jack thinks he is a great deal more than
‘nothing.’ At least, Dalky thinks so, or he never
would have brought him west as his valet,” explained
Dodo, laughingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander frowned at his evident error,
but he added: “It’s enough to make a man talk
ten ways to onct! Having such trouble tag on at
his heels!” But he failed to designate the particular
“trouble,” though he glared at Algy in a
way that said: “You are the cause of all the misunderstanding.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Jack had hurried to Mr. Dalken’s
side and was explaining something in a low whisper.
Mr. Dalken seemed to receive light on a
problem, and then he shook his head disapprovingly,
even though he had to smile as he disapproved.
Jack took a chair nearby, and, as soon as
Mr. Alexander had stopped speaking, he cleared
his throat and resumed.</p>

<p>“My master says that I am to continue the
plans, since I have them prepared. So, awsking
A. A. A.’s pawdon for my offensive self, I will
say this much:</p>

<p>“One trip we ought to take is the one which
goes to St. Michael’s Mission, and from there
on to Canyon de Chelly and Canyon del Muerto,
by way of Fort Defiance, in Arizona. If we had
enough time we also ought to tour onward from
Chinlee, to Monument Valley and the marvelous
sights in the northern section of the State. Those
points of interest which may be approached from
the Flagstaff tour can be visited later, when we
start for the Grand Canyon trip.</p>

<p>“Another trip we ought to take, starting from
Gallup, is the trail due north to the Ute Indian
Reservation, and the Mesa Verde Park. These
trips will use up seven or eight days’ time, and
Dalky figures he will be through here in that time.
Therefore, in order to take in the visits to the
Painted Desert near Adamana, and the Petrified
Forest, just across the borderline of Arizona, we
might motor from Gallup, as we turn our backs
upon New Mexico, and continue on our way to
Flagstaff in automobiles, instead of on train.
That will give us ample opportunity to see the
wonderful sights along the route, and we can remain
as long as we choose at each place. After
reaching Flagstaff, the cars can be sent back to
Gallup. Now, what do you say to these plans?”</p>

<p>As Jack finished his plans, he glanced hopefully
around at his friends to receive their delighted
thanks and approval for his arduous sketch. Instead
of hearing words of commendation, such as
he had expected from the girls and Mrs. Courtney,
he heard Mrs. Alexander’s voice.</p>

<p>“No one seems to notice the insult to a lady—of
course, my husband does not count, since he
never took lessons in social deportment and modern
etiquette, so his words spoken a short time
ago bear no weight with me;—but I refer to insults
to ladies by allowing men-servants in
friendly intercourse with their betters. I have
tried to stand this degrading intimacy with a common
valet, and I must say that, if the young man
is going to run this trip, I shall leave the party!”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander stood up during the delivery
of this frigid speech, and, having had her say,
stared at Mr. Dalken, whose eyes seemed riveted
upon the floor, and his tongue likewise riveted to
silence. Then she shifted her glance to Mrs.
Courtney, who seemed eager to have Mr. Dalken
explain matters. Then her eyes wandered on to
the three girls who were stifling their laughter
with handkerchiefs. This was too much for the
complainant.</p>

<p>“Very well! I am to understand that the fellow
remains at his post as major domo, so I am
to leave the party. But I will add that my daughter
and Mr. Alveston, as well as my husband,
Mr. Alexander, leaves with me. Come, Dodo,
follow me and pack your trunks.” And Mrs.
Alexander beckoned her child to obey.</p>

<p>“Don’t try any funny stunts like this, Maggie!”
commanded Mr. Alexander, getting up from his
chair and placing a restraining hand upon Dodo’s
shoulder. “I’m cashier of this outing, remember,
and I ain’t got no patience with your fol-de-rols.
It’s bad enough to have to foot the bills for your
escort, but I figger he comes cheaper, at that,
than a maid would cost me. So let him stick to
the job, if he likes. About traipsin’ away with
Dodo and me, howsomever—that’s a horse of another
color, and it’s a color I don’t take to. If
A. A. A. wants to run away, we’ll shake a by-by
at him and wish him a safe journey back home—wherever
he started from. But you stay right
with me—understand!”</p>

<p>“Why, Ebeneezer Alexander! Do you think,
for one little minute, that I’m going to be ordered
about by you?” demanded the irate lady, flushing
as red as a peony, with pent-up fury. “I just
reckon not! I’ll go now, if only to show you that
you can’t make me do as you say. I’ve got enough
money left from my Colorado Springs trip to
take me as far from you as I can get. Then dear
Algy will see that I go further.” She was so
excited that she failed to understand that she
had made a laughable remark about the end of
her proposed journey.</p>

<p>Algy now arose gallantly to the demand upon
his chivalry. “I certainly will escort yuah theah,
deah lady,” mumbled he, tugging at his infantile
mustache.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander threw back his head and
laughed loudly. “Well, mebbe it’s just as well
that you two git out. You never was invited, remember,
and my good friends never said a word
about your gettin’ on their nerves, but I can appreciate
how broken down their feelin’s must be
by this time. We-all kin get a rest, now. And
mebbe Algy will see to it that you two travel all
the way to Reno!”</p>

<p>“Father!” came from Dodo, in shocked tones.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Dodo. They won’t take the
hint, but I shall have to, if your Ma sails off in
company with that poor stick.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had reached the door by this
time, and she merely turned to give her liege
lord a scathing look. Then she vanished behind
the portières. Algy toddled at her heels.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” cried Mrs. Courtney, in deep distress,
“when Jack begged me to pretend he was a
valet, I never dreamed the joke would assume
these dreadful phases. Now it is time it was
stopped, Mr. Dalken.”</p>

<p>“I told Jack this evening, when he explained
what had been the impression given to Mrs. Alexander and her young friend, that I disapproved
of the entire plot. Now it is up to him to get us
out of the unpleasant scrape,” replied Mr. Dalken,
seriously.</p>

<p>“What’s all this?” demanded Mr. Alexander,
wonderingly.</p>

<p>Dodo now began to explain to her father how
the mistake of Jack being a servant had started,
and how it had been received by Algy. She
spared her father the story of how her mother
danced with Algy at the hop, in the hotel at Albuquerque,
because he seemed annoyed enough at
the fact that a member of his democratic family
would spurn a young man for no other cause than
that he was earning his living.</p>

<p>“I say, it serves that white-haired dude right—to
let him show what’s in him, by the way he
acts now. But Jack won’t have to play valet
longer, with Algy out of the way,” explained Mr.
Alexander.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney did not agree with the little
man, and she lost no time in saying what she
thought. “It is not fair to Mrs. Alexander to
play the joke any longer. Dodo must appreciate
that her mother is her natural guardian and as
such must be honored and obeyed. We must try
to explain away the differences between us all, and
introduce harmony for the remainder of the
tour.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken showed his appreciation of these
words, by the glance of admiration he sent Mrs.
Courtney; but the glance was not seen by Polly
or Eleanor, because they were too concerned
about their “fun.”</p>

<p>“We-e-ll,” came slowly from Mr. Alexander’s
lips, “you ought to know what’s right, Mrs.
Courtney; but I must say, my Missus ain’t so
much a guardian and protector of her child like-as-how
you seem to say. Little Dodo’s got me
to advise her, and to see that she don’t make mistakes
in choosin’ the wrong husband—but the
Missus would have her gal marry any dumb-bell,
as long as he had a title er money. Ain’t it so,
friends? I appeal to you: how about the Urope
tower, when Dodo and me had to elope to get out
of marryin’ that Osgood dude, eh?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had heard of this unique elopement
of Dodo with her Dad, and she could not
help smiling at the remembrance. Still she felt
that certain respects were due Mrs. Alexander,
in spite of that lady’s foolishness and ignorant
chase for society honors, and she said so now.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken upheld her verdict, and then he
turned to Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, seeing how eager you were to keep on
acting as my valet, we will make use of you as
one. It is part of your duty to me. I will write
a letter of explanation to Mrs. Alexander, and
tell her of your engagement to serve me during
this trip—that you were to escort the girls and
their chaperon to different places on this Southwest
tour, thus affording me all the leisure I
would require to attend to my business appointments.
I will confess that you have other resources
to live upon than the salary I pay you;
then I will admit that the salary is merely nominal,
since you were eager to take this journey
with us. If that doesn’t fetch the lady to her
senses, then I shall have to try and discover other
means. Now, you all keep quiet while I write.
Then we will order Jack to deliver the letter at
Mrs. Alexander’s door in person.”</p>

<p>Since Mr. Dalken was Big Chief of the party,
there could be no objections to his plan, and soon
he was seated at a writing-table. He wrote
quickly for some time, then read aloud what he
had written. He blotted the sheet, and folded it
carefully, then placed it in an envelope and wrote
the name and room number on the outside. Then
he handed this note to Jack with orders to deliver
it at once.</p>

<p>“We shall await your return, Jack,” said Mrs.
Courtney, settling herself in a comfortable position
to wait.</p>

<p>Jack looked slightly inclined to rebel against
his orders, but Mr. Dalken had turned away towards
the fire-place, and the young ex-valet sauntered
out of the room. The girls watched with
a grin of sympathy upon their faces, but not a
word was spoken by any one present. Mr. Alexander,
as though defying his wife’s strict commands,
pulled the old black pipe from his pocket
and loaded it with Cut Plug. Then he struck a
match on his trousers leg, and lit the tobacco.
In another minute he was smoking away like a
clogged chimney.</p>

<p>Jack was absent more than the specified ten
minutes allowed by his friends, but when he did
come back he was laughing to himself.</p>

<p>“Oh! do tell us all about it!” exclaimed the
girls, eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, siree! I had to take that bitter dose
without the sugar you girls might have given me,
and now I have no intentions of sharing the
sweets that I earned. But you may find out all
about it, some day. Suffice it for me to say: the
awful scandal which threatened the sweet accord
of the Alexander couple has been avoided by my
diplomacy. Henceforth Mr. Alexander and his
daughter Dodo will be made supremely happy
by having Mrs. Alexander dote upon them, as all
turtle-doves should.” Jack laughed.</p>

<p>“Jack! You are rude!” reprimanded Mr. Dalken,
frowning.</p>

<p>“I’ll say he’s gone queer in the head,” added
Mr. Alexander, knocking the ashes from his pet
pipe, and getting up to leave the room. “If he
figgers any one’s goin’ to watch me romancin’
again, after the experence I had fer nigh thirty
years, it shows he’s gone luny. Rather than live
up to his idee, I’ll quit the works—so I will!”</p>

<p>As the little man rushed away, Mr. Dalken
jumped up and ran after him. It must have taken
a deal of explanation and assurance from the
leader of the party to Mr. Alexander, to calm his
fears and make him feel that he was not in any
immediate danger of having his wife daily make
love to him.</p>

</h2>

<p>The following morning Algy failed to appear
in time to join the tourists. Mr. Dalken and Mr.
Alexander wished them all a good time, and then
hurried away to the business meeting. Mrs.
Alexander had ordered her breakfast served in
her room, but she sent word to Jack that she
would be down in time to start with the others on
the auto trip.</p>

<p>Finally, having waited half an hour longer
than the time appointed for starting, Jack sent a
bell-boy up to the room occupied by Algy, and
Dodo went to telephone her mother to hurry, if
she wished to accompany them.</p>

<p>Dodo came back to her friends with an impatient
expression upon her face.</p>

<p>“Ma says she will be down in just <i>one</i> little
moment. That means another half-hour to wait!
May as well sit down and take life easy, Jack,”
remarked she.</p>

<p>“It does seem a shame that we have to lose a
whole hour of this wonderful day, and then have
to rush over the sight-seeing after we are there,”
declared Eleanor, angrily.</p>

<p>At this moment the bell-hop returned to the
waiting group with his astounding information.
Word was brought Jack that Mr. A. A. Alveston
had checked out that morning, leaving no
word of explanation. Then he turned and went
away again.</p>

<p>“Why! Of all things!” exclaimed Polly, astonished
at what she heard.</p>

<p>“There must be some mistake. I can’t picture
Algy having enough gumption to do such a thing
without some one to coach him in it.” So saying,
Jack hurried to the clerk to find out if the message
was correct.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Baxter,” replied the clerk, politely.
“I was just coming on for my morning duty when
the young man paid his bill and left orders with
the porter for the forwarding of the trunks.”</p>

<p>“Trunks! He only had one, I thought,”
gasped Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ll call the porter and you can speak to him,”
said the man.</p>

<p>The head porter was called and Jack learned
from him that four trunks were removed and expressed
to Williams. Jack felt perplexed, but
he concluded that it was a fortunate day for his
friends when silly A. A. A. had sense enough to
realize that he was not a very welcome addition
to the Dalken party. Then he hurried back to
tell his companions of the strange move made by
Algy.</p>

<p>“Don’t let’s waste time wondering why he did
it, but let us enjoy the respite he is giving us. It
will be dreadful to find him awaiting us at
Williams as he is sure to do, because he hasn’t
pep enough to plan any journey for himself. I
will wager anything that Ma is the cause of this
sudden move of his, and she can explain how he
managed to get away so early without saying
good-morning to us,” said Dodo.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Alexander was seen approaching
the group. She was smiling too genially
for one who had nothing to hide, and long
before she joined the watching circle of friends,
she began to apologize for her tardiness.</p>

<p>“You see, it is so difficult to dress without the
help of a maid. I am unaccustomed to doing my
hair and hooking my gown. And, of course,
Dodo <i>never</i> thinks of me, in these little acts of
kindness.”</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil the day’s outing by explanations,”
retorted Dodo, impatiently. “It’s bad enough
for you to have held up the entire crowd for an
hour.”</p>

<p>Jack started for the door, and the others now
followed him, but it was plainly seen that Mrs.
Alexander’s coming had failed to add joy or peace
to the party.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney now spoke to the lady. “We
heard, to our amazement, that Mr. Alveston has
gone. He evidently plans to remain at Williams
for some time, since he had his trunks sent there.”</p>

<p>“Is that so! Well, we need not weep over
that,” returned Mrs. Alexander, pleasantly.
“Algy is a dear boy, but he <i>does</i> get on one’s
nerves at times, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I really cannot judge, since I paid so little
attention to him, you know,” replied Mrs. Courtney,
just as sweetly as her companion had spoken.
“He seemed to be always attending you, and I
was engaged in attending the girls, you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so! Algy must have felt himself
out of the group of young folks. He was quite
important a personage at the Springs, however,
and Dodo was the envied one of all the girls
there. How different it must have seemed to him—to
be secondary in your party,” said Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney remained silent after this, because
she detested hypocrisy and preferred silence
to such empty conversation. So the two
ladies took their seats in the car without further
explanations.</p>

<p>While Jack was advising the driver about the
trip, Dodo turned to her mother and spoke.</p>

<p>“What under the sun made you send A. A. A.
on with the trunks?”</p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i>! As if I was responsible for his
leaving you!” the lady sighed, as though the accusation
was too much for her to bear.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind, Ma! We’re all thankful
you did it, because it would have been too distressing
to have him slide down one of the high
cliffs we will visit, or get mixed up in an Indian
brawl, or lose himself as usual, when we go to
inspect queer caves and ancient canyons,” laughed
Dodo.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander seemed mollified at this, and
subsided with a fixed smile upon her lips. A smile
that seemed to say sorrowfully: “I’ll be pleasant
no matter what you do or say to me, since I am a
martyr, anyway.”</p>

<p>The young people soon forgot Algy, and Mrs.
Alexander exerted herself to be agreeable to Jack,
hence the trip proved to be very enjoyable to all.</p>

<p>The week passed quickly with so much sightseeing,
and the genial company that agreed pleasantly
upon every suggestion Jack made for them.
Then Mr. Dalken and Mr. Alexander concluded
their conferences at Gallup, and, in company with
Mr. Fuzzier, informed Jack that they were ready
to leave. Jack then arranged with a man who
owned several fine cars to drive the entire party
to Adamana, which was the nearest stop to the
Painted Desert, just north of the town, and the
Petrified Forest to the south of it. It had been
decided to visit the Painted Desert first, and then
drive through the Petrified Forest the next day,
and come out near Holbrook, where the entire
party could spend the night. In the morning the
three business men would continue to Ash Fork
where they were to remain for a week, to consult
privately with several prominent men. The party
under Jack’s supervision would motor to the Hopi
Indian Reservation, where the wonderful Keams
Canyon and the remarkable Hopi Mesas were to
be found. Going southerly from Polacca, he
wished his friends to visit the Giant’s Chain, and
then follow the autoroad from Oraibi to the
Painted Desert of the Little Colorado. Thence
he would turn off this road and follow the one
which led to Canyon Diablo. Here they would
stop long enough to see all the points of interest,
and then motor on to Flagstaff.</p>

<p>This route was followed, and a week later the
two cars ran into Flagstaff. The passengers and
their luggage were soon waiting in the hotel while
Jack paid off the drivers of the automobiles and
sent them back to Gallup. To the delight of the
three girls, Mr. Dalken and his two companions
met them as they entered the hotel. This meant
that Dalky would be with them when they visited
the Cliff Dwellings just south of Cliffs, a wonder-spot
which they had seen in the distance when
motoring past.</p>

<p>Soon after the party had gone to their individual
rooms to brush away the dust and dirt of touring
in a wind which carried the desert dust upon
its wings, Jack’s room-telephone rang. He answered
it at once, and heard his guardian’s voice.</p>

<p>“Jacky, old boy, what do you plan to do the
rest of the day?”</p>

<p>“I paid off the chauffeurs and sent them back
to Gallup, because I learned how much cheaper
are the cars in Flagstaff. But I have not hired
any; I wanted to hear from you first,” returned
Jack.</p>

<p>“Can you come down—or shall I come up?”
asked Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“I’ll run down—I was about to leave my room,
anyway,” said Jack; then he hung up the receiver
and left the room.</p>

<p>A few minutes later he met Mr. Dalken, and
sat down beside him to plan for the week.</p>

<p>“I suppose you all expect me to go about with
you to visit the side-shows of Flagstaff, eh, Jack?”
asked Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” returned Jack. “The girls were
awfully glad to find that you were here and would
be at liberty to stick to the bunch.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is what I had planned to do, my
boy, but we—that is, Alex., Fuzzy and myself—find
we can drive with you as far as Montezumas
Castle, but we will have to leave you there, while
we go on to inspect a stretch of land now for sale.
It is not generally known to be for sale and Alex.
says we must get an option on it before the United
Copper Company gets wind of the thing. We
just heard of this last night—Fuzz got a code
wire from Chicago, and you understand that we
have to work fast, eh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken seemed anxious, as he confided this
news to Jack, and the young man understood how
important it was that his guardian should be excused
from joining the tourists.</p>

<p>“Why, Dalky, every one of us will give up our
outings if, by doing so, we might help you in this
work you are developing. Just you go on exactly
as though you were here alone with Fuzzy and
Mr. Alex., and never waste a thought upon us. In
fact, I have done nobly, thus far, with A. A. A.
out of the way. Ask Mrs. Courtney if you doubt
that I made a fine guide.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that reminds me!” exclaimed Mr. Dalken,
laughingly. “I saw Algy—but I will wait
and tell the crowd about it later.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fuzzier strolled up at this moment, and
Jack got up to shake hands with him. Then the
newcomer spoke to Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“I’ve been doing a little private detective work,
Dalken, and I find that a stranger who reminds
me of one of the directors of the Copper Company
is staying at this hotel for a few days. Now,
how in the name of conscience are we to get away
without their suspecting our intentions? Lucky
we took Alex.’s advice and registered under assumed
names.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken turned to Jack and said: “You
know what I told you just now? Well, the girls—and
Mrs. Alexander particularly—must be
warned not to greet me as a returned wanderer
from Ash Forks. If any one lurking about finds
out how Fuzzy, Alex. and I have been scouting
around the country in quest of capitalists to subscribe
for our new company’s stock, the whole
plan of opening the tract Alexander discovered
may go up the flue. On the other hand, it seems
providential that we all arrived about the same
time, since it will seem plausible that we are on
a tour of the Grand Canyon and nearby points
of interest. I will leave it to you, Jack, to tell
every one in our party that secrecy about my
movements, since I left New York, is imperative
if they wish to help me succeed. This afternoon
at—say—two, we will get in the cars and start to
visit Montezumas Castle, you returning here to-night.
But, silence, Jack, upon the confidential
plan I told you—about our going on from the
Castle, and sending you and the ladies back alone—understand?”</p>

<p>“Sure! I’ll skidoo upstairs now, Dalky, and
warn the three girls and Mrs. Courtney about it.”</p>

<p>“Exactly! And I’ll send Alex. up to his wife
to put her on guard about giving things away to
strangers—her usual failing,” added Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>Then before another word was said, Jack hurried
away, and the two men hastened to the smoking-room
to tell their third partner to go find his
wife, and impress upon her the necessity of keeping
mum about the actions and business meetings
of her husband and his partners.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander smiled cynically as he listened
to his friends’ advice; then he replied: “Like-es
not, Maggie’ll fly off the handle and shout all she
knows from the housetops, just to badger me into
agreein’ to let that perky dude marry Dodo!”</p>

<p>“Oh, good gracious!” exclaimed Mr. Dalken.
“The whole continent of South America isn’t
worth that dreadful mistake.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry, friends,” explained the little
man, smiling as an idea entered his tremendous
brain. “I’ll fix things so’s Maggie will be feeding
out of my hand for a few days, and by that time
there won’t be no risks of losin’ that property.”</p>

<p>As it was none of Mr. Dalken’s business what
his friend said or did in his private family circle,
he did not ask Mr. Alexander how he planned to
keep his wife from publishing the news of her
husband’s close association with a man who added
prestige to her social position. As this news
would tell others that three financiers were affiliated
in a way that might bode ill to competitive
financiers, it would be as well to suppress the publisher
before she could broadcast her tidings.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander hurried away to reach his wife’s
room before she could confide in the chambermaid,
or come down to the lounge to see if she
might find any one of importance to whom she
might introduce herself, as was her usual custom
when left alone.</p>

<p>In the sanctity (?) of their private room, Mr.
Alexander began to approach his subject in a
round-about manner.</p>

<p>“Well, Marguerite, glad to see you lookin’ so
good. This bracin’ air sure does agree with your
complexion and tone. A few more weeks of the
same tonic will take twenty years more off your
face.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had just been examining her
face and color in the mirror, and she felt worried
over a small wrinkle which she thought she
detected at the corner of her eyes. In spite of all
the wrinkle plasters she used nightly, this fine line
crept in unawares, it seems. But her husband’s
surprising compliment—so unusual from him—pleased
her mightily.</p>

<p>“Do you really think so, Ebeneezer? I was
just thinking how worn and aged I had grown
since I started on this tiresome tour.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Not a bit, Marguerite! I’m the
only one that looks worn and aged. If we-all
didn’t know better, you and Dodo could pass for
sisters, all right. I wonder you never thought of
lettin’ her go visitin’ for a season, or so, just to
see if folks at home would credit you with havin’
such a grown-up gal,” continued the wily little
man.</p>

<p>“It does seem too bad, doesn’t it, that Dodo
really advertises my age to the public. I know I
look very young to have such a big girl, but I try
to have society people understand that she <i>looks</i>
much older than she is. Still, I don’t know but
you are right.” Mrs. Alexander mused silently
over her husband’s remark, after she had had her
say. Mr. Alexander watched quietly and waited
for her to make the next move in this game.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to try your plan out, when we get
back to some fashionable place in the East, Ebeneezer,” finally said Mrs. Alexander. “Every
one in your party knows me here, and even Algy
would laugh if he heard I was trying to play a
joke on the public by passing as Dodo’s sister instead
of her mother.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what you might do, Marguerite,—just
to try and get your hand into the game before
we-all reach Grand Canyon, which is a fearful
high-toned place, you know. That El Tovar
Hotel is one of the swellest houses in the country,
and folks dress to beat the band. Now, I’ll strike
a bargain with you, dearie, if you want to have
some fun by posing as a young lady, heartfree and
ready for a beau, eh?”</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander’s interested smile and his good-natured
offer would have hoodwinked a wiser
person than his wife. Being so willing a victim
to blandishments, Mrs. Alexander was ready for
the proposition instantly.</p>

<p>“What bargain do you want to make? I’ll
agree to anything that doesn’t annoy me,” returned
she, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s this. That you don’t let on Dodo
and me are your husband and daughter until after
we leave Arizony. I’ll make believe that Dodo’s
and my name is Ammerman—see. You hang on
to Alexander, and pose as a flapper, if you like,
with Dodo and the other gals your chums. Then
I’ll put Dalken wise, to play up as amateur
sweetheart, and Fuzzy must be your steady company.
That makes a fine little comedy, I say, and
we’ll see if folks swallow the bait. I’m sure Dalken
and Fuzzier will enjoy the joke as much as
you will. The girls are always out for a lark,
and that leaves Jack and Mrs. Courtney to fix.
But, then, Jack will see the fun to be had out of
the play, and Mrs. Courtney doesn’t count any
in this plan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Ebeneezer!” cried Mrs. Alexander delightedly
clapping her beringed hands. “It would
be too funny for anything! I can just see myself
with two admiring lovers following around after
me. If you think the others will see what a joke
it will be, I’ll play the star part until we leave
Grand Canyon. What a lot of romantic tête-à-têtes
we can have in that lovely resort!”</p>

<p>Her husband grunted silently to himself. But
he could not afford to lose, now that he had won
thus far, so he hid his disgust at his wife’s social
aspirations and her yearning for a vanished
youth, and he now made known what she must do
for him to clinch the bargain.</p>

<p>“You must act the part of a modest, retiring
young lady, Mag—Marguerite, and keep close to
Mrs. Courtney, since she is the chaperon, you see.
Don’t flirt with other men, but make believe you
have your hands full of trouble with keeping off
the two elderly beaux. I’ll put Dalken wise to
the play, but Fuzzier is half in love with you already,
I see. He’s not any too particular about
loving another man’s wife, I fear, so he’ll be glad
of a chance to make up to you. Now, then, for
my promise to keep Dodo and myself out of your
way, and let you make believe you are Miss Alexander,
of New York, or London, or some other
big town: you’ve got to keep secret that you ever
knew a miner by your name; or that Dalken is a
widower, once removed, with his chum, Fuzzier,
out here on business. To play the game right,
Dalken and Fuzzier ought to take new names,
too. Fine fix it would be, if some one, knowing
of Dalken’s fame as a New York millionaire, read
his name in the hotel register, and then reported
to all the newspapers how he was mad over you!
The same about Fuzzier—only he’s famous in
Chicago. Now, I won’t stand for any such newspaper
notoriety, understand? If you want to try
out your hand at acting a part, it’s got to be
done proper, and then I’ll stake my money on
you, old gal!”</p>

<p>“Oh! If that is all,” laughed his wife, in relief,
“I can promise that at once. It doesn’t make
a bit of difference whether the two men change
their names, or what they do, as long as we go on
with the fun. Then we shall see whether folks
really think me as young as my friends tell me I
look.”</p>

<p>“Better begin right here, Mag—Marguerite!
I’ll go and coach your beaux how you are <i>Miss</i>
Alexander, and we ain’t no family of yours. Then
I’ll see the girls and teach ’em their parts, too.
You dress the part, and when we start off for
Montezumas Castle, you’ll have things your own
way, see?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes! Hurry away and do as you say.
I’ve got to find a youngish dress in my baggage.
What a pity I shipped my trunks on to Williams.
I had lots of Dodo’s fine clothes in them, and
they’re just what I need for this joke.”</p>

<p>“Why not have Dodo loan you one of her suits
for to-day? I will send her here to find out what
you want. A few days from now, and you will
have your trunks sent on to Grand Canyon, you
know,” advised her husband, pleasantly.</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Run on, and tell Dodo
to come to me at once. But don’t you go and
ruin all the fun by calling me by my first name,
as though you knew me intimately!” warned his
wife.</p>

<p>“No danger!” laughed Mr. Alexander, as he
skipped out of the door and closed it carefully
behind him. Then he shook with mirth as he remembered
how he had slandered the Chicago
bachelor, Fuzzier, and how scandalized Dalken
would be to find he was Mrs. Alexander’s lover.</p>

<p>The little plotter hurried to Dodo’s room to
tell her the news, and she laughed with her father
at his description of Mr. Fuzzier being a flirt,
and having intentions to fall in love with Mrs.
Alexander. But Dodo became serious, when she
understood the reason for keeping her mother so
interested in Mr. Dalken and Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“You’d better run and prepare Dalky and his
friend, Daddy, or they’ll escape. Don’t shock
them suddenly, but do it by degrees, if you want
them to survive,” laughed Dodo.</p>

</h2>

<p>Mr. Alexander might have spared his friends
the disagreeable part of playing sweethearts to
his wife, because the man who had been at the
hotel when the Dalken party arrived, left there
that same day, without having discovered that the
supposed competitors for the envied tract of land
south of Montezumas Castle were right at hand.
But it was not so simple a matter to dispose of
Mrs. Alexander’s yearnings to pretend to be a
youthful magnet once more. Having received
such an unusual suggestion from her practical, unromantic
husband, she took full advantage of it—much
to Mrs. Courtney’s disgust and certain
pangs of jealousy. Thus the first surprise came to
the three men who had been plotting to evade the
man they thought was in Flagstaff for a secret
purpose. Had they known that this same man was
then on his way to Williams, where he had heard
the New York and Chicago financiers were to be,
what might have been their fears—knowing that
Algy was lounging about that small town, waiting
for Mrs. Alexander to give him the next cue?</p>

<p>While Mr. Alexander stood grinning at his two
associates, after having confided to them the plan
he had evolved to protect their interests, Jack
crossed the room to join them. He saw the expressions
of fierce rebellion upon the faces of Mr.
Fuzzier and Mr. Dalken, but he had no key to
the situation then.</p>

<p>“Say, Dalky, it’s pretty late to start for the
Castle now, because there is no comfortable place
where we could spend the night, you see?” asked
Jack.</p>

<p>“I don’t care where we go—Alex. has made
such a mess of things,” growled Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander chuckled aloud, then turned to
Jack and told of his wonderful plan to throw dust
in the eyes of the supposed Director of the Copper
Company. Jack laughed heartily, when he
heard that his guardian and Mr. Fuzzier were expected
to play the roles of romantic beaux.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Polly came down the stairs,
and, seeing the men standing as though waiting
for their friends, she hastened to join them.</p>

<p>“I left Nolla and Dodo with Mrs. Alexander,
who is unusually anxious to make a good impression
upon the gentlemen of our group,” explained
Polly, with an amused laugh at Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Humph!” came from that disgruntled individual.</p>

<p>Then Jack spoke to Polly. “I was just telling
Dalky that it was too late to start for the Cliff
Dwellings to-day. We ought to get up early in
the morning and have a full day in which to properly
see the Castle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I thought the main object in this trip
was to help Dalky and the other two men to get
out of the way of their competitor for that tract
of land? If that is so, we’d better lose no more
time, because I saw that man start off in an automobile
just as I was about to leave my room, before
coming down here,” explained Polly.</p>

<p>“By Jingo! Then we’d better be off!” exclaimed
Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“I should say so!” added Mr. Dalken, turning
to catch hold of Jack’s arm. “You run out and
see if we can start in a car at once—Mr. Alexander,
Fuzzy and myself. Hustle a good driver
into the seat, and tell him not to wait for anything.”</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear more Jack hurried
away to do his guardian’s bidding, and Polly was
left to answer the anxious questions of the three
men. All she could add to her information, however,
was of no consequence to the three speculators.</p>

<p>“Polly, we’ll leave you to explain to the others
why we had to rush away without waiting to say
good-by,” said Mr. Dalken, taking Mr. Fuzzier’s
arm, to make him come with him.</p>

<p>“What about our luggage, Dalken?” asked
Mr. Alexander, not so anxious to go away in this
fashion.</p>

<p>“Oh! Jack will attend to that. The bags can
be taken on to the Grand Canyon, where we will
meet the ladies.”</p>

<p>Thus, before the rejuvenated mother of Dodo
could appear to captivate her two promised admirers,
they had vanished from Flagstaff. Jack
saw them off, and then turned to laugh at the
whole plot.</p>

<p>“If we could get rid of Mrs. Alexander as
easily as she rid herself of A. A. A., there might
be hopes of enjoying ourselves during the next
few days. But she will be in a dreadful mood
when she learns how her beaux have disappeared.”</p>

<p>Polly laughed, too, because she could picture
the consternation of Dodo’s mother. It would be
difficult to make her believe the truth about the
sudden departure of the men, and little Mr. Alexander
would have to bear the brunt of her anger
in the long run.</p>

<p>Soon after the automobile carrying the three
financiers had rolled away, Mrs. Alexander “in all
her conquering glory” came into the room where
Polly and Jack were wondering how she would
receive the news. She certainly meant business—if
one might judge of her intentions by her costume
and make-up. Eleanor and Dodo wisely
remained out of sight of their companions; there
would have been a unanimous scream of laughter,
had they met each other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, dearies, here I am, ready to start, when
you say the word,” began Mrs. Alexander, but
she looked around quickly for signs of her promised
suitors.</p>

<p>“All right, Mrs. Alex.,” replied Jack suavely,
“we are all ready, too. Come, girls! The car is
outside.”</p>

<p>Jack and Polly led the way, and in a short time
all were in the automobile, and the chauffeur was
given the word to start.</p>

<p>“But, wait! Where are the gentlemen?” cried
Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>“Oh! they will not be with us on this short outing.
We are going to drive to the Lowell Observatory
this afternoon, and postpone the trip to
Montezumas Castle for to-morrow. You see,
such an outing will need the most of an entire
day, if it is to be enjoyable,” explained Jack, nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“All the same, I don’t see why they couldn’t
have come with us,” complained the lady, sulkily.</p>

<p>Eleanor and Dodo had not heard of the unexpected
departure of the three men, and they were
not in the surprise which Polly and Jack would
have to spring upon them later. So they all drove
to see the famous observatory where investigations
of the planet Mars were made. Late that
afternoon they returned to the hotel, Jack wondering
how he should tell Mrs. Alexander that
her beaux had fled.</p>

<p>Flagstaff, being a popular summer vacation
place, was, at this time of year, quiet and settled
for the winter’s rest. Consequently the tourists
might be said to have taken possession of the
hotel, since so few visitors stopped there during
the cold season.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the hotel Mrs. Alexander
looked eagerly around for her husband and his
two friends, and Jack seized this opportunity to
inform the dismayed lady of the necessity of their
hurried trip.</p>

<p>“Well! Any man that would consider a paltry
strip of western land in preference to a <i>lady</i> isn’t
worth wasting my time. Let Ebeneezer run them
off, as I’m sure he did in order to annoy me, but
I’ll find other company, just as good as those two
old men!” threatened Mrs. Alexander, angrily.</p>

<p>Having delivered herself of this ultimatum
Dodo’s youthfully dressed mother turned haughtily
away and went up to her room. The other
members in the group were too tired to bother
about changing their motor clothes for the evening,
and they decided to have supper, dressed as
they were, and then retire in order to be up
early in the morning for the trip to the Castle
cliffs.</p>

<p>Dodo telephoned to her mother’s room to tell
her they were waiting for her to join them in the
dining-room, but Mrs. Alexander said she was
having her supper sent to her room. Therefore
the young people and Mrs. Courtney thought no
more of the matter, and enjoyed the hot meal
while wondering what the three absent men were
doing.</p>

<p>Upon bidding each other good-night, later in
the evening, Jack reminded all that the car would
be ready at eight the following morning.</p>

<p>“We’ll be ready, too, never fear,” returned
Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>And so they were; but Mrs. Alexander sent
word by Dodo that she had had enough of gazing
at blank walls and pretending to go into raptures
over a gaping hole!</p>

<p>“Just like Ma,” added Dodo, having given the
message to Jack. “If that hole, or the wall, was
noted for the visits paid by some personages of
fame, she’d camp on the spot in order to say she’d
been one of a party where the princess, or a governor,
or some other big gun was the feature.”
Dodo’s disgusted tone and expression told plainly
that she did not favor such pretensions.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s too bad we have to leave Mrs.
Alexander alone all day, but she prefers it to going
to the cliffs,” sighed Mrs. Courtney, starting
for the automobile.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about Ma. She’ll console herself
with a yellow novel,” said Dodo.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney did not approve of the manner
in which Dodo spoke of her mother, and she
wished the girl would use more consideration in
speaking so disrespectfully of her before Polly
and Eleanor, but she felt that she had no right
to advise or correct another woman’s daughter.
And Polly and Eleanor, knowing that Dodo spoke
truly about her mother’s weaknesses, kept silent
on what they thought to be rather blunt statements.</p>

<p>That day was spent in seeing the National
Monument of cliffs situated on Beaver Creek, in
the Verde Valley, and by sunset time they were
on their way back to their hotel.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we will visit Humphrey’s Peak,”
said Jack, looking at his trip-book. “I was told
that we can get one of the finest views of any in
the west from the top of that peak. The clerk
at the hotel says it is possible, on a clear day, to
see over 75,000 square miles of territory—think
of that! Don’t forget your kodaks, girls, because
you’ll want them once you get to the top of
the peak.”</p>

<p>“It seems rather risky, Jack, to try to gain
the summit of that peak in this cold weather,”
remarked Mrs. Courtney. “The snows will have
made the trails impassable, and the guides may
have trouble in finding the way.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ll see how high we can climb
without losing our way,” returned Jack, indifferently.</p>

<p>“The auto can carry us part way up the mountain,”
added Polly, “and we can ride horses the
rest of the way, if the day is pleasant.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought,” explained Jack.
“Carry the lunch in the car, and eat before we
start for the climb to the peak. It will be easy
enough to come down again, and then we will be
back in the hotel by dark.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney was not so sure about it all,
and she determined to inquire of the hotel proprietor,
if the trip would be absolutely safe.</p>

<p>When the party of five went to the desk to ask
for mail, they were surprised to hear that Mrs.
Alexander had paid her bill and departed. All
the word she left was that she would meet them
at the hotel at Grand Canyon. This news annoyed
Dodo, because she felt sure that her mother
had stopped to get Algy at Williams, and would
go on to Grand Canyon without a thought of
being misunderstood by others who knew nothing
of her social aspirations. She was gone, however,
and nothing more could be done about it.</p>

<p>Jack and his friends went to sleep that night
fully convinced that Mrs. Alexander had called
for Algy, and then gone on to Grand Canyon with
him. And Mr. Dalken, with his two companions,
anxious to forestall the Copper Company
by securing options on the great tract of land
south of Montezumas Castle, believed the little
hoax Mr. Alexander had played upon his wife
had worked successfully to keep from their competitors
all facts about their launching a new
company to mine the valuable ore from the Verde
Valley. Perhaps it was just as well that no one
knew what Mrs. Alexander was doing, and what
she contemplated doing for the next few days.</p>

<p>After leaving the hotel at Flagstaff, Mrs. Alexander
had boarded the train and went as far as
Williams. Here, as Dodo had thought, she expected
to find Algy and persuade him to attend
her on the way to the Tovar Hotel at Grand
Canyon. But she was destined to have another
disagreeable surprise.</p>

<p>She had not telephoned nor wired Algy that
she would arrive that noon, because she was so
sure he would be impatiently waiting for her. To
her dismay, therefore, she found that a Mr. Dunlap
had been at the hotel for a few days and had
struck up a sudden friendship with young Alveston.
Then Algy, dissatisfied with his lonesome
life at Williams, swallowed the tempting bait held
out to him by the wily promoter. When Mr.
Dunlap proposed that the young man be his guest
upon a little side trip to an interesting point which
he was about to visit, Algy hailed the invitation
as a godsend. Consequently the two started off
in a luxurious limousine at about the same time
that Jack and his party left the hotel at Flagstaff
for Montezumas Castle.</p>

<p>Because of this acceptance of the invitation,
Algy was not to be found when Mrs. Alexander
arrived. The man who owned the hotel at Williams,
where Algy had stopped, knew only that
the trunks had been sent on to Grand Canyon,
and that the young man had driven away in another
man’s car.</p>

<p>“I’m sure they went on to Grand Canyon, so
I’ll take the next train from here. What time
will I get there?” said Mrs. Alexander, having
to hide her annoyance, since no one was present
upon whom she dared vent her anger.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to wait around here for several
hours, Ma’am, as there will be no train until four
this afternoon. You’ll get to Grand Canyon in
time for supper,” explained the man, politely.</p>

<p>“Dear me! And there’s nothing for me to do
here, is there?” she exclaimed, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Well, that depends on what you like to do.
Now, we-all find so much to do, every day, that
the days are too short for us,” laughed the man.</p>

<p>“I suppose everybody—that is every one worth
while, goes right through to Grand Canyon, so
Williams never sees society people,” remarked
Mrs. Alexander, with a superior air, calculated to
impress this mere nobody of a man.</p>

<p>“Sometimes society persons find themselves
stranded here,” chuckled the man, who cared
naught for this lady’s hoity-toity manners.
“There happens to be such a man, right this minute—just
as mad at being delayed in his plans,
as you can be. He’s said to be some punkins back
in Chicago, where he’s a big lawyer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really! Who is he?” asked Mrs. Alexander,
finding life might be bearable in Williams.</p>

<p>“Why, he’s the Executor of the White Ranch,
down Verde Valley way. He is said to reckon
his income with seven figures to the left of the
decimal!”</p>

<p>“I do not think I am acquainted with him,
though I have met so many millionaires lately
that he may be one of them,” mused Mrs. Alexander,
seeming to be trying to recollect.</p>

<p>“Reckon you haven’t met this one,” continued
her informer. “He only left the ranch yesterday,
and must have expected to meet some arrivals
in this town to-day. They didn’t arrive,
and now he’s got to stay over and do some waiting,
I’m told. If you happened to know him, it
would help kill time for you.”</p>

<p>“That would be very pleasant for me, but he
is not around, and I’ll be going on to Grand
Canyon in a few hours’ time.”</p>

<p>“You must have struck a lucky day, Ma’am,
for here comes Mr. Belnord—the man I was just
telling you about. He’s strolling across the
verandah this minute, as though he wanted to
kill time. He’ll ask me if there is any telegrams
or ‘phone messages in another moment,” whispered
the gossipy clerk.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander knew the man to be a stranger,
but she made up her mind to get acquainted with
a millionaire who might be looking for a companion
to wile away wearisome hours. Hence
she planned quickly.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! I met him in ——” exclaimed she.</p>

<p>Just as the frowning gentleman reached the
desk to address the clerk, the lady who was standing
there dropped her costly handbag. Naturally
the newcomer picked it up and bowed politely as
he returned it to the owner.</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you,” said Mrs. Alexander in a demure
tone. Then in a surprised way, held out a
daintily gloved hand, as she exclaimed gladly:
“Why! If it isn’t Mr. Belnord! To think of
meeting you in this out-of-the-way spot. The
last time I saw you was over a year ago, at a fête
in Chicago.”</p>

<p>She acted the part of a delighted old friend to
perfection, and Mr. Belnord, chagrined that
he could not place so charming a lady, accepted
her word for it and kept rummaging through the
memory cells of his brain for a possible clue to
her identity.</p>

<p>They shook hands like old friends, and Mrs.
Alexander began to rattle off her complaints
against a railroad that failed to run a train to
Grand Canyon to accommodate her. Then she
added naively: “My father, Mr. Alexander, and
my younger sister, Dorothy, were to have met me
here to-day, but I suppose they went on with Mr.
Dalken and Mr. Fuzzier to visit the cliffs of the
Verde Valley. I am weary of so many side-trips,
and I decided to meet them here. Do you remember
my sister, Mr. Belnord?”</p>

<p>“No, Miss Alexander, I’m ashamed to say I
do not. I remember I saw nothing but you, when
you were present, remember,” replied the gallant
gentleman of forty years. “But Fate has
been more than kind to me to-day in giving me an
opportunity to amuse you while you are delayed
by the wretched train service.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander managed to hold back a smile
of gratification at the success of her little trick,
and Mr. Belnord considered himself very clever
in learning the lady’s name with so little trouble.
But he also caught the names of the three men
he had cause to chase,—and the very three he was
waiting in Williams to meet—if the estate agent,
Dunlap, was to be trusted. It now behooved him
to find out all he could from this talkative woman,
who evidently had reached the spinster’s age of
garrulity.</p>

<p>The two walked slowly away from the desk,
and sought the comfortable easy chairs in the
parlor. Here Mrs. Alexander proceeded to captivate
her new admirer, being wary to steer clear
of reefs whenever the conversation seemed to
turn to their former friendship.</p>

<p>But Mr. Belnord cared naught about former
or future friendships—he was anxious to learn
about the present plans of certain men this lady
knew, and so, before she boarded her train for
Grand Canyon, where she expected to find Algy,
he had found out all he needed to know for the
present.</p>

</h2>

<p>The three men, Mr. Dalken, Mr. Fuzzier and
Mr. Alexander, having been fortunate enough to
secure an experienced driver of their car, now
began to notice the scenery along the road to
Montezumas Castle.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry we had to run away without the
girls. How pleasant it would have been to
hear their exclamations and delight at these wonderful
cliffs,” remarked Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“You-all wouldn’t have had much chance to
listen to the gals, because my missus would demand
all your attention, onct she knew she could
count on you-all fer beaux,” chuckled Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“Well, then, it is our lucky day that we got
away as we did,” retorted the shy bachelor, Mr.
Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“I wonder what she will do when she finds out
how we escaped?” mused the lady’s husband.</p>

<p>“Ten to one she will be after us!” laughed Mr.
Dalken.</p>

<p>The road was not in good condition, and the
three men had not examined the car before engaging
it for this hard trip, therefore they were
not aware that the tires were badly worn. As the
road became rock and rutty, however, Mr. Dalken
spoke to his companions.</p>

<p>“Seems to me the tires are not as hard as they
might be,” said he.</p>

<p>“The one on my side, rear, feels as though it
were flat, or about to be so,” added Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander opened the door to have a backward
glance at the doubtful tire. At the time he
opened the door the car was just running through
a mass of gravel-covered road, and the wheels
flung the pebbles up with great force. One exceptionally
large stone was whirled and thrown
backwards as from a sling-shot. It struck Mr.
Alexander square between the eyes with such velocity
that he crumpled back in the automobile
as though shot. The only sound he made was a
grunt as he fell.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! What’s the matter, Alex.?”
cried Mr. Fuzzier, who sat on that side of the
car. But he received no reply. “Not a drop of
anything on hand to revive him!” muttered Mr.
Dalken, banging upon the glass in front to attract
the chauffeur’s attention.</p>

<p>The driver turned to see what was wanted of
him, and at that moment the car swerved the
fraction of an inch. But that fraction was quite
enough to cause the wheels on one side to run into
a deep rut. This hard jolt sent all three men together
in a heap. Poor Mr. Alexander happened
to be underneath, and Mr. Fuzzier on top. Mr.
Dalken, being between both, received no hurt, but
Mr. Fuzzier struck his head against the closed
door, and soon a great swelling rose there and
closed his left eye. Mr. Alexander, being unconscious,
could not swear or complain against his
tough luck of being the under one.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken now lost all patience, because of
fear of what had happened to his companion and
with this last mishap. He discovered then, that
he had not forgotten how to curse politely, and,
once started, it seemed as though he would never
stop. Even Mr. Fuzzier, with his head aching
and throbbing like mad, and deeply concerned as
he was about Mr. Alexander, had to laugh.</p>

<p>The chauffeur sprang from his seat and rushed
to that side of the car which was down in the
rut. Instead of coming to the help of his passengers,
he began to look around for a visible
means of getting the wheels up out of the mire.</p>

<p>“You dolt! come here, won’t you?” shouted
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Got anything we could use to help restore
consciousness to this man?” demanded Mr. Fuzzier,
shaking a fist at the driver.</p>

<p>Then the chauffeur found that one of his passengers
had been seriously injured, and he immediately
feared they might hold him responsible,
because he thought it was due to his accident in
driving. He sprang upon the runningboard and
peered in at the crumpled little man, with fear
plainly expressed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t stand there like a mummy!” called Mr.
Dalken, “but open that door and help us lift the
man out of this.”</p>

<p>Thus admonished, the chauffeur did as he was
bidden, and, in a few moments, Mr. Alexander
had been taken from the car and carefully placed
upon the bad road.</p>

<p>“I hope, sir, the gentleman hasn’t broken his
neck, sir!” whispered the driver, trembling in
fear.</p>

<p>“If he hasn’t, it isn’t because of your careful
driving!” snarled Mr. Fuzzier, the swelling beginning
to rise to the size of an egg.</p>

<p>At this moment the man discussed sighed
heavily, and in another few moments he opened
his eyes and blinked dazedly at the blinding blue
sky overhead. At the same time, the three men,
all anxious to help their unfortunate companion,
started suddenly to stoop over his prostrate form
and offer assistance to him.</p>

<p>What must be the natural result of having two
men upon opposite sides of little Mr. Alexander,
unexpectedly bend far over the form between
them? Mr. Dalken and the chauffeur could tell
any one after that just what did happen. But the
collision of the two heads seemed to do more
damage to Mr. Dalken’s forehead than to that of
the other man. Perhaps this was due to the fact
that the chauffeur was a hardened young man,
while the New Yorker was soft from luxurious
living. Anyway, without going into the cause, it
remained plainly evident that both men, thereafter,
bore the marks of the collision. The driver’s
head showed a great bluish lump, and Mr.
Dalken’s eyebrow raised up and caused an enormous
swelling above the eye so that it seemed impossible for the skin to stand more stretching
without a break.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander now sat up and stared around.
He saw two men glaring at each other as though
they would like to strangle each other; and the
third man stood with mouth open, watching the
other two. He was entirely forgotten—or to be
exact, he was <i>overlooked</i> in this interesting scene.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon! I got’a turrible
smack on the head!” exclaimed Mr. Alexander,
lifting a hand to feel of the injured spot.</p>

<p>“You’ve got more than a smack there, old
man,” retorted Mr. Fuzzier, placing a hand under
each arm and helping his friend to scramble to
his feet. “You’ve got a lump about the size of a
football, that will mar your beauty, all right!”</p>

<p>“But, say, Fuzzy!” gasped Mr. Alexander, in
amazement, as he stared at the man addressed,
“what struck you, when the gravel flew? You
ain’t such a prize-winner in our beauty contest,
either.”</p>

<p>That made Mr. Fuzzier roar with appreciation
of the truth, and in another moment all four men
were laughing as though they had just heard the
funniest joke ever told.</p>

<p>“If we needed any disguises to-day, to keep
those competitors from recognizing us, we found
them all right!” exclaimed Mr. Dalken, feeling
gently of the awful lump over his eye.</p>

<p>“Had any one told me this yarn—of how four
men got swelled heads over nothin’ more’n a bit
of gravel in the road, I’d say, ‘come off your
perch, Mr. Lawyer!’” laughed Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“If I look half as fetching as you do, Dalky,”
remarked Mr. Fuzzier, “I’d wear a mask. You’ll
frighten away the jack-rabbits, I fear.”</p>

<p>“All right, Fuzzy. Tell the chauffeur to find
us four masks—there is little choice between us,
so far as looks go!” was Mr. Dalken’s reply.</p>

<p>“If you gentlemen expeck to get to that cabin
south of Sedona to-day, we’d better hoist this
machine out’n the rut, and get along,” advised
the driver of the car.</p>

<p>“Hoist! What can we hoist with?” demanded
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Reckon we got’a put our shoulders to the
wheel,” grinned the man. “I’ll git under the wust
end and jack the car, somewhat.”</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander had recovered sufficiently from
the blow of the stone to help with his hardened
muscles. After much puffing and straining of the
four men, the automobile was pushed and pulled
out of the ditch. Then they got in again, and the
driver started the engine.</p>

<p>“I was remarking, not so long ago, that I wish
the girls might have been with us,” was Mr. Dalken’s
smiling remark. “Now I am thankful that
only four heads were batted in this ball game. If
there had been more of us, there would have been
more aching heads.”</p>

<p>“Umph!” grunted Mr. Alexander, “I might’ve
said how my blow came as punishment for my
foolin’ the missus. But that wouldn’t account fer
your heads!”</p>

<p>“No, it’s one of those strange freaks of nature—to
have four men traveling together, and
each one bearing upon their foreheads the mark
of a misspent life,” laughed Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“Why not quote Scripture, Fuzzy, and say ‘the
mark of the beast,’” added Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“Because I must confess that I’ve forgotten all
that I ever knew of my Bible.” Then, as an
afterthought, he added: “But tell me, Dalky—how
is it that you can remember so well, since your
Sunday School days?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken returned the quizzical look, and
replied: “I may not look it, but I will admit that
I often find time to go to church, and more times
than I will tell you or the world, I find a verse or
a bit of advice in the Bible that does me a lot of
good. Men of Big Business can’t afford to overlook
the Science to be had by referring to the
Holy Book.”</p>

<p>“Well! I’ll be doggoned! If you aren’t the
last man I ever expected to hear that from!” exclaimed
Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>Thereafter the subject was suddenly changed,
and Mr. Fuzzier spoke of the prospects of reaching
the ranch, whence they were bound, in time to
take advantage of the Copper Company.</p>

<p>No unforeseen accidents occurred until after
they passed Montezumas Castle, though the leaking
tires caused many delays in order to have
them pumped full of air. The road was not constructed
of rose-leaves, either, and the jarring
and jolting of soft tires over rocks and ruts made
sore heads ache fearfully.</p>

<p>The unfamiliar appearances of the men with
the black and blue eyes, and the unusual excrescences
upon the foreheads, caused frequent roars
of laughter from one or the other of the three
men. And the chauffeur came in for not a little
of the ridicule because of one prominent cheek-bone
and half-closed eye.</p>

<p>The road from the Cliffs, where the Castle is
located, goes westerly as far as Clarkdale. Sedona,
where the three speculators hoped to be
before dark, was located several miles from this
road, about half the distance between Clarkdale
and the Cliffs.</p>

<p>The chauffeur, having had a painful lesson
about careful driving, decided it would be wiser
to halt long enough at the Cliffs to change the
leaking tire, than to continue on and stop now
and then to pump it full of air. This took time,
but the men assisted in every way possible in
order to gain time.</p>

<p>Once more they were traveling along the road
which runs to Clarkdale, and hopes were in the
ascendant that Sedona would be reached by sundown.
Very few travelers were met that day,
and when, just before turning off the main road,
to reach Sedona, a very fine automobile was spied,
like a tiny dot, coming from the opposite direction,
it attracted general attention.</p>

<p>The two cars turned into the Sedona road
with but a few minutes’ difference in time—Mr.
Dalken’s car led, however. As the chauffeur
found a good bit of road ahead, he turned and
spoke through the tube at his side.</p>

<p>“I know the driver of that car, sir. He comes
from Williams, and has been down to Flagstaff
twice this past ten days. He had a man from
Prescott, who’s been looking out for some men to
arrive from Chicago, but they didn’t show up. I
reckon Mr. Dunlap got tired of waiting around,
and is on his way back to the ranch where he
hopes to make a clean-up.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the man called Dunlap?” asked
Mr. Dalken, giving his friends a silencing look,
when they would have exclaimed at the surprising
information just heard from their chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Only from hearsay. Jim—that’s the owner
of that rear car—says he’s very flush with his
coin, and hired the car for a week. I saw the man
at Flagstaff the last time he waited there for the
men he expected.”</p>

<p>“Did Jim hear who the men were—the ones
that didn’t show up?” asked Mr. Dalken, trying
hard to keep the eagerness out of his tones as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“No; but I overheard him ask the agent at the
railway station if he was quite certain that three
men did not come from Chicago and get off at
Flagstaff. And the agent said he was sure! He
also told Dunlap that the only men to arrive at
Flagstaff in the week, were three from Ash Fork,
but they were not millionaires, because they were
dressed like any other hard-working chaps—not
a diamond or spare penny to be seen.”</p>

<p>“You seem to be an observing young man,
chauffeur,” ventured Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“It pays to observe sometimes—specially when
things are humming right under one’s nose. Now
I observed that you three men came from Ash
Fork, but I should not say you were hard-working
men—that is, with your hands. Your brains
might work hard. I’ve done a little amateur detective
work now and then, and I’ve enjoyed it.
If I had to keep my comings and going dark, and
should folks keep tabs on my movements from
Chicago on to a certain spot in Arizona, I’d buy a
ticket to Ash Fork and then back-trail to Flagstaff—as
you three men have done this time. Am
I right?”</p>

<p>His three passengers laughed outright; then
Mr. Dalken replied: “You have over-stepped the
line, young man. We did come from Ash Fork,
as you noticed, but we had no movements to keep
dark. In fact, we traveled with a gay and noisy
party of young people, and stopped at every town
along the Sante Fé where there were sights to be
seen, or places to be visited. So, you see, it is
merely a coincidence that there are three of us,
and your man Dunlap had been expecting three
men, also. Besides I am from New York, and
Mr. Alexander is from Denver, so there is another
count gone wrong.”</p>

<p>“What’s your name, driver?” now asked Mr.
Fuzzier, taking a pen and address book from his
pocket.</p>

<p>“I’m Bill Beldon, a native of Gallup, but doin’
business in Flagstaff. It’s busy there in the summer
season.”</p>

<p>“Well, Beldon, I’m going to confide a little
secret to you and surprise my friends here at the
same time. If I make it worth your while to help
me out of this fix, and keep your lips sealed about
what you see or hear, will you stand by me?” Mr.
Fuzzier winked at his two companions for silence,
and Bill Beldon was instantly interested in this
new development of what he considered a fine
case for a detective.</p>

<p>“All right, Beldon. I’ll take your word, in
front of these two witnesses, to be as good as a
bond. Now, gentlemen, prepare for the surprise:
I’m one of those men from Chicago, but the other
two did not come. And I’m the man the agent
Dunlap is after, but I do not wish him to catch
up with me. Now, then, if Beldon can step on the
gas and get us to our destination half an hour or
so before Jim gets there, I’ll make it well worth
his efforts.”</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon!” exclaimed Mr.
Alexander, winking at a great rate, as he tried to
make his voice sound full of surprise at what he
had just heard.</p>

<p>“You are the closest mouthed man for a friend
that I ever had,” added Mr. Dalken. “You
never told me a word of this secret.”</p>

<p>“Why should I? I wouldn’t have told you
now, only Beldon has shown me that it is best
to confide in the three of you. Well, Bill, what’s
your answer?” laughed Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m your man, all right! I’ll sign my
name to a paper if you can manage to draw it up
whiles this car is jogging over the road,” exclaimed
Beldon, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Look behind us, Dalken, and see how far
away that other car is?” advised Mr. Fuzzier.
“And, Alex., you get out the box of lunch we had
packed for the girls—I grabbed it up and shoved
it under the seat, when it was decided that we
start at once for the ranch.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken did as he was requested, but his
report quickly drove all thoughts of lunch from
their minds. “That other car has caught up with
us—it is not more than twenty feet behind this
one.”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Fuzzier caught the tube and spoke
to Beldon: “If you let that other car pass you,
Bill, you don’t get a cent. I’m a fine friend, but
I’m a nasty enemy. Now get busy and keep that
friend of yours in the rear—better still, get speed
up and run away from him. I’d even bail you out
of jail if you cracked the tires on that rear car.
Understand how important this thing is?”</p>

<p>“I sure do! And Jim can’t go back and say he
made me take his gasoline smoke!” retorted Beldon,
starting off at high speed, the moment a good
bit of road was found.</p>

<p>Between Mr. Dalken and Mr. Fuzzier, the
rear car was kept constantly in sight—now it
drew nearer, then Beldon forged ahead; then the
rear car would drop back, because the leading
car would gain a long lap in the race. But the end
was not yet, since Dunlap was not the man to lose
out in a speculative deal whereby he had hoped
to profit. He now knew from Algy that the three
men he had been expecting had arrived in Flagstaff, but they had not registered at the hotel, as
he had thought they would do. He cursed himself
for thinking that three millionaires would
travel to Arizona to inspect a mining property,
and wear clothes or gems to advertise their
wealth. He should have known better, he
thought.</p>

<p>Another thing that Dunlap had done, which
had been a brilliant idea, was inviting the insignificant
little heir of a fortune to tour with him.
Algy had accepted gladly, but he had no idea of
the tortures he would have to endure while on that
trip. He had looked for a comfortable, enjoyable
drive along fine state roads. Instead, he was compelled
to endure jolts and jars that shook his frail
little form as it had not been shaken since his
heavy-handed father had died. Puny Algy did
not like this method of traveling, but he had to go
on, because Mr. Dunlap declared he could not turn
back, nor was there any way Algy could reach a
house or hamlet until the end of the journey.</p>

<p>Dunlap had no intention of letting this member
of the Dalken party slip from his grasp, so he
stood Algy’s whimperings, and tried to soothe his
plaintive begging to be sent back to dear Mrs.
Alexander!</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI</span><br />
  <span style='font-size:1.0em'>WHAT HAPPENED ON HUMPHREY’S PEAK</span>
</h2>

<p>Jack’s party drove to Humphrey’s Peak as
had been planned, and there they found that the
automobile road leading part way up the mountain
was in splendid condition. Therefore they
decided to try to reach the peak, and get the marvelous
view from the summit.</p>

<p>All went well while the good road continued,
but once they got to the place where it became
necessary to leave the car and take to horses, it
was not quite comfortable. The guide thought
they were taking chances against the weather—it
had been cloudy all morning and the weather
bureau had prophesied flurries of snow during the
day.</p>

<p>“A little snow won’t melt us hardened tourists!”
exclaimed Eleanor, laughingly.</p>

<p>“Not after one has lived through Flat Top
blizzards,” added Polly, springing into the saddle
on the horse she was to ride.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, miss, but October is the latest
month the guides think safe for folks to try for
the peak. If you-all insist upon going up, I can
take you, but it must be at your own risk, remember,”
explained the man.</p>

<p>“The weather has been unusually warm and
open,” said Jack, coaxingly, “and we are sure
there is no risk to take.”</p>

<p>“The guide ought to know his territory better
than we do, Jack,” argued Mrs. Courtney, troubled
at what would be best to do.</p>

<p>“Oh, come on, folks!” commanded Dodo, impatiently.</p>

<p>“Yes, do come on, or the day will pass in
arguing,” abetted Jack, jumping into the
saddle.</p>

<p>“Well, if you-all will promise me not to go beyond
the zone which I think safe and will agree
to turn and come back the moment I signify
the return, I’ll take you,” finally agreed
the guide.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, if there is any unusual risk,”
begged Mrs. Courtney, anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t! If the young people will promise
me that, it will be perfectly safe,” returned
the man.</p>

<p>Being so eager to start for the climb, the four
younger members of the group promised instantly.
And off they started.</p>

<p>The altitude of Humphrey’s Peak is 12,750
feet, and the approach to the summit is made over
a gradually ascending road and trail made through
mighty forests of pine. Aspens grow in thick
profusion here and there—so thick, indeed, that
one could not thread a way between the trunks
without chopping away the obstruction. Reaching
timber line, however, nothing grows beyond
to hide the bare crags which continue on up to
the very summit.</p>

<p>On the ride through the magnificent forest the
guide told of the extensive view to be had from
the peak—directly north, fifty miles away, one
could see the walls of the Grand Canyon; still
farther, were the Buckskin Mountains of the Kaibab
Plateau; to the north-east one might see the
Painted Desert, and beyond that the Navajo
Mountain. Then, turning southward, one could
see the White Mountains; and, gazing westward,
one saw the Mogollon Plateau and other famous
ranges. The Santa Fé railroad threaded the valley
east and west like a winding serpent with head
and tail hidden from sight. Small towns and settlements dotted the country, and gave the necessary
action to the wonderful picture.</p>

<p>“But I doubt if you will see these sights to-day,
friends,” concluded the guide. “If you reach
timberline without freezing in the saddle, you
will do well.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure you do not appreciate our hardihood,”
declared Polly impatiently. “I was
brought up in the Rocky Mountains, near the
highest peaks, and I am accustomed to this life.”</p>

<p>“You forget, Polly, that several years in New
York City, in steam-heated houses, and the enervating
life we live there, may have changed your
hardihood,” remarked Mrs. Courtney, gently.</p>

<p>“Oh, well! that remains to be seen,” retorted
Polly.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said about the hazards to be
met on the way, and thereafter every one felt
buoyant and happy, because of the delight in
riding good horses and the exhilarating air of the
mountains.</p>

<p>Up and up and up climbed the well-trained
horses, and finally the guide called a halt to rest
the beasts. The riders leaped from the saddles
and stretched their legs and arms for a time, then
walked around to investigate the plateau. Only
a few minutes were allowed for the rest, then the
guide called them to re-mount. As they ran to
obey, Jack thought he saw a snowflake whirl
across his vision. But he would not report it.</p>

<p>By the time all were ready to resume the ride,
Jack was sure he saw another flake of snow falling
slowly upon the horn of his saddle, still he
would not speak of it.</p>

<p>But the guide had noticed the few scattered
bits of snow, and he was determined to take no
chances with his party. He led the way to a
crosstrail on the mountain-side, and took the side
trail instead of the one which ascended directly
ahead of the riders. He planned to follow this
gradually ascending road for a time, and, should
the flurry of snow prove nothing more, he could
regain the main trail farther on where another
crosstrail struck upward. In case the snow came
down heavier, and threatened to continue, he
could lead his party back down the mountain from
that crosstrail.</p>

<p>But a careful guide’s plans may go astray, even
like the wise mice in the fable, and so it happened
with Job Barnes.</p>

<p>The pines were noticeably shorter and more
slender as the trail ascended higher and higher,
and it was also seen that the trees looked tougher
and many of them bore scars left by the winter
storms. Many were twisted and their tops
blunted from the fierce gales and blizzards which
swept like cyclones over the peaks. But the trail
continued good and interesting, and the little
cavalcade rode on with many a merry jest and
carefree laugh.</p>

<p>Finally they entered a thick forest of aspens
through which the trail accommodated no more
than one horse at a time. It was after riding
halfway through the length of this forest, that a
sudden gale of wind came down from the peaks,
and with it came a great cloud of snow. Instantly
the air became choked with fine snow, and the
temperature dropped suddenly so that every one
in the party began to shiver and shake. The
horses, rebelling against going on in the face of
this cold blizzard, balked, but they could not turn
in the narrow tunnel between the aspens.</p>

<p>Fortunately the guide rode first, and Jack
brought up the rear, so that the horses of the girls
could not back nor forge ahead in order to get
away from where they were.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” shouted Jack, to get orders
from the guide.</p>

<p>“Wait for a few moments and see if she blows
over.”</p>

<p>So they all sat as though frozen to the saddles,
while the guide tied a rope to the horn of his
saddle and then jumped from his horse and carried
the rope back to tie a loop to each saddle in
the line behind his horse. When Jack’s horse,
the last one, had been thus hitched up in line, the
guide advised him.</p>

<p>“Don’t let your horse balk or stampede. Use
your spurs, if necessary, to control him. We’re
near a nasty bit of road that runs along the rim
of a rocky ravine, and I’d like to keep this side
of it if I can manage the animals so they will
move slowly. I might have to chop down enough
aspens to allow the horses to turn, so we can ride
back the way we came, but chopping trees takes
time, and I brought but one axe.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be all right,” was Jack’s assurance.
“Just go on carefully, and warn us when we reach
the gulch.”</p>

<p>Another ten minutes was given to a slow progress
along the narrow trail, and, then, the storm
growing heavier, the guide decided to dismount
and begin to cut down enough aspens to permit a
turn in the trail. As he jumped down, however,
his feet became entangled in some way in the rope
which he had tied to his saddle, and he fell. His
foot struck upon a slippery projection of rock,
and, turning over, down he crashed with a groan,
bringing his heavy weight upon the twisted member.</p>

<p>The full import of this accident did not filter
into the brains of the other riders for a second;
then Jack saw the guide slump in a heap and he
knew the man had fainted in spite of his endeavors
to remain conscious.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Barnes is knocked out! He
must have hurt himself seriously!” cried Jack,
springing from his saddle.</p>

<p>Polly was so experienced in handling situations
of this nature that she quickly got down from her
horse and hurried to the side of the injured guide.
Before Jack could lift Barnes’ head, Polly was
beside him and had placed a restraining hand
upon his arm.</p>

<p>“Just make him as comfortable upon the
ground as possible, Jack, and then help me
straighten out his leg. Perhaps it is not badly
hurt,” advised she.</p>

<p>Thus, while the other three riders waited anxiously,
watching from their horses, Jack and
Polly helped the guide to a more natural position,
and Jack fumbled for a possible flask of whiskey
in the man’s pockets.</p>

<p>Polly began to unlace the leather legging and
heavy mountaineer’s boot, but her fingers were so
stiff with cold that she could not undo the wet
laces. Jack had found a flask, and, pouring the
cup-top on the bottle full of brandy, tried to force
some between the lips of the man.</p>

<p>Not more than five minutes had passed since
the guide had first leaped from his saddle, but in
that time the snow had fallen so heavily that
everything was covered with a white blanket.
And the gale increased in velocity so that it blew
the snow in every direction, and seemed to drive
it under the riding clothes of the stylishly clad
tourists.</p>

<p>After a second attempt to get some brandy
down the throat of the guide, Jack succeeded and
was repaid by seeing the eyelids twitch and slowly
lift. Then the man became conscious all at once,
and sat up, though he did not move his foot—it
seemed limp.</p>

<p>“What a fix!” exclaimed Barnes, in disgust with
himself. “A broken bone, and out here in this
blizzard!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Barnes—I’ll cut down the
aspens for you, and Polly, with the other girls,
will drag them out of the way. The work will
keep us from freezing,” said Jack, cheerily.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget me,” called Mrs. Courtney, trying
to act as cheery as Jack.</p>

<p>“If you only knew how to manage it, you ought
to throw the blankets over the animals, or we
may not have them fit to carry us back to the
cabins,” suggested the guide.</p>

<p>“We <i>do</i> know how to do it,” replied Dodo. “I
was brought up in Colorado, and Polly knows
enough about horses to break the worst broncho.
Jack, too, has been on the ranch. Just watch us.”</p>

<p>So saying, Dodo jumped from her saddle, and
Eleanor managed to slide out of hers. It took
Mrs. Courtney longer to dismount, as she had become
so cold and stiff.</p>

<p>The three,—Jack, Polly and Dodo,—then began
to remove the saddles that they might pull
off the blankets which were strapped under them.
This done, they started to rearrange the blankets
in order to cover the quaking horses.</p>

<p>“Jack, you better get busy chopping the aspens,
because Dodo and I can blanket the animals,” suggested
Polly.</p>

<p>“Good! Hand me the axe from Barnes’ side,”
returned Jack, turning to the man who was trying
to get upon one foot and assist the girls.</p>

<p>“You just sit still, Barnes—or you’ll have a
compound fracture. We’ll get this straightened
out in a jiffy,” said Jack. Then he took the axe
and began to whack at the nearest aspen. It was
one directly ahead of Barnes’ horse, and Jack
figured logically that cutting down the few ahead
of the horses would make it easier for them to
turn, because the leader could step in and go
around the narrow turn he proposed making.
Then they would face the opposite direction from
the one in which they now stood.</p>

<p>Polly and Dodo had blanketed three horses,
and all three girls were engaged with the others,
when Jack whacked a hard blow at the tree he
was felling. The axe struck sideways, and a long
sharp chip flew up and scuttled horizontally
through the air. It struck the leading horse directly
between the eyes, and that poor beast, already
frightened by the blasts of howling wind
which bore such cold sheets of sleet and snow into
his face and chest, leaped up on his hind legs. In
a second, he came pounding down again, and then
started off along the trail, pulling the other horses
in his wake.</p>

<p>The three girls were so frightened at what had
happened that they were incapable of moving for
a moment; consequently Eleanor was thrown
against an aspen with such force that she had the
breath knocked out of her. Polly had been half
over the back of one horse, in order to work a
blanket down to the other side, and she was carried
along while clinging desperately to the mane
of the beast she was upon. Dodo was flat in a
snow-drift.</p>

<div id='003' class='mt10 mb10 w003'>
  <img src='images/illus-003.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>POLLY WAS CARRIED ALONG CLINGING DESPERATELY TO THE HORSE’S MANE.</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had been attending to Barnes’
injured foot, and now she sprang up and called
aloud in sudden fear. “Polly!”</p>

<p>Jack left the axe where he had dropped it and
started off hot-footed to catch up with the escaping
animals. The snow impeded the hoofs of the
leading horse, and he soon found that running
away in the teeth of a blizzard was not the fun
it was in town, when he began to cut capers for
amusement to those around. He had not galloped
more than a hundred yards before he began
to breathe hard. The high altitude had a lot to
do with this, too, but the beast knew nothing of
altitudes. In the length of a few more yards he
was glad enough to halt and try to catch his
breath. This, naturally, stopped the other horses
that were being dragged willynilly at the heels of
their leader.</p>

<p>Jack ploughed through the broken snow as fast
as he could lift his feet out of the clinging drifts,
and after a hard sprint he caught up to the sweating
animals. But now! how to turn them about?
That was another problem, and he gazed in despair
at the closely standing aspens which lined
the sides of the trail.</p>

<p>Polly made a horn of her cupped hands and
shouted at him. “Only one thing to do, Jack, and
that is—cut down the aspens over there, instead
of here. We’ll have to come and help you, and
leave Mrs. Courtney with the guide; we’ll pick
them up after we get the horses turned about.”</p>

<p>Jack signified he had understood, and then,
holding fast to the bridle of the leading animal,
he waited until Polly brought the axe. The other
girls followed in Polly’s tracks, and, after a tiresome
hike, they all went to work to remove the
obstructing aspens. Jack now wielded the axe,
with a zeal he had been unconscious of possessing,
and the three girls worked in breaking down the
younger growth of trees and throwing them back
upon the trodden trail; since they would not return
that way, but would lead the horses about
the short turn they were making through the
woods, it made little difference.</p>

<p>No one stopped to eat, though all were half-famished
and half-frozen, as well. Mrs. Courtney
tried to keep Barnes from being chilled, by
helping him hop around upon one leg, keeping the
injured one free from the ground. As Barnes
was a heavy young man, and he had to lean upon
his companion for support, she was thoroughly
tired out by the time the horses were successfully
led back through the narrow cleft made in the
aspens. In fact, so narrow was it that many a
tree-trunk scraped the sides of the horses as they
were pulled and pushed and urged to go along to
gain the good, though narrow, trail ahead.</p>

<p>This much was successfully accomplished at
last, and the young people, who had had to chop
and break down the aspens in order to get the
horses turned about, heaved a sigh of gratitude
when they halted the animals beside the guide.</p>

<p>“Now, our next job will be to hoist Barnes into
his saddle,” remarked Jack.</p>

<p>“That is not a difficult thing to do, because I
know how to help myself under all unexpected
circumstances,” was the cheery reply from the
guide. As he spoke, he hopped over to his horse’s
side and caught hold of the saddle. At that moment
a ray of sun burst through the black snow-clouds
and glinted upon the winking eyes of the
group of surprised riders.</p>

<p>“Well! can you beat that for contrariness?”
cried Polly, glancing angrily up at the breaking
storm-clouds.</p>

<p>“Just as we’ve finished our hard labor, to find
the blizzard isn’t going to blizz any more!”
laughed Eleanor, whimsically.</p>

<p>“If the sun comes out eventually, what are we
going to do—go on or turn back?” asked Dodo.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can’t go on with Mr. Barnes in this
condition. We must return as quickly as possible
and see that he has surgical attention,” declared
Mrs. Courtney.</p>

<p>“Well, it is a great disappointment, not to see
the view we were led to expect from the summit
of the peak, but I am so tired out with shoveling
snow, and with removing trees from this forest,
that I’m just as well pleased if we get back to
Flagstaff and can roll over into a warm bed,”
was Polly’s verdict.</p>

<p>“Reckon you’re right, Poll!” agreed Jack, as
he sprang up into his saddle.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon was spent in carefully
riding back to the cabins where the guides
lived while the trails remained open. Here the
old mountaineer who did the cooking for the men
during the season, soon had steaming coffee, with
bacon and eggs, ready to serve.</p>

<p>The girls would not have believed how good
greasy eggs fried in bacon fat could taste, until
that afternoon. Jack commented upon the evident
relish with which they ate whatever was
placed before them.</p>

<p>“No wonder!” laughed Polly, seeking carefully
for the last crumb of black bread, “wood-cutters
always come in after a hard day’s work, with appetites
like ravening wolves.”</p>

<p>“That’s us!” declared Dodo, ungrammatically.
Then she smacked her lips with relish over the
coffee, while her companions laughed.</p>

<p>Poor Barnes had the worst of that ride, for
the small bones of his ankle had been fractured
and he would have to keep it in splints for a long
time, if he would have it knit well and be as good
as ever. But this accident proved to be beneficial
for future riders up Humphrey Mountain, for the
trail was ordered to be made wider and kept open
and clear to protect man and beast in the future.</p>

<p>That evening, at the hotel, Polly remarked to
her friends: “One place on the map that we won’t
see this trip!”</p>

<p>“I’m not grieving,” laughed Jack. “I’ve seen
all of that peak I ever care to.”</p>

<p>“Um! I’m with Jack in that sentiment,” added
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“‘Them’s all our sentiments, too!’” giggled
Dodo.</p>

</h2>

<p>Jack managed to escort his friends to all the
other places of interest which they had decided
to visit, and then, having heard from Mr. Dalken
and his two companions that they were not to
wait for them, the five members of the party at
Flagstaff decided to go on to Grand Canyon,
where they expected to meet Mrs. Alexander and
Algy.</p>

<p>They heard from Mr. Barnes the last day of
their stay in Flagstaff, and were pleased to learn
that he was recovering quickly from his injury.
Then they bid the hotel people good-by and
started for Grand Canyon. They arrived at a
time of year when few tourists think of visiting
Arizona and its wonders. But they found that
the first of December was the most wonderful of
all seasons in the year to see the Canyon and the
surrounding scenery. It beggared all attempts at
description, when the snow flurried over the great
abyss, or the sun reflected a million points of
colored lights from the icy crags and the frozen
drips of water!</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander, during the interval she had
spent alone at El Tovar, had wearied herself with
showing off all the costumes she had brought in
her trunks; also she had had a most glorious time
in smiling engagingly at every man who had registered
at the hotel. It made no difference to this
rejuvenated lady whether the male guests were
young, or middle-aged, or decrepit—her attentions
were bestowed alike with impartiality.</p>

<p>It had, therefore, become a standing joke with
the hotel employees whenever a newcomer made
his appearance, to wager just what he might do
to escape the flirtatious lady. But no member on
that staff dreamed that the lady was the wife of
the plain, little millionaire from Denver.</p>

<p>She had been determined to play without marital
limitations; consequently, learning that Algy
had not appeared there, she had registered at the
El Tovar as “Miss Alexandria Marget,” and had
thought herself most clever at the way she had
changed her name.</p>

<p>When her grown daughter, Dodo, appeared
upon the scene, however, Miss Marget could not
explain her former masquerade. And the hotel
clerks were chagrined to find that they had been
making sport of one of the wealthiest women in
the west. Dodo, not aware of her mother’s pastime,
paid little heed to the humble attendants at
the hotel.</p>

<p>The first day at Grand Canyon was devoted to
visits to the Hopi and Navajo Indian settlement,
where the girls watched with interest the handicraft
workers in beads, willow, hide, and other
curious things.</p>

<p>The second day at Grand Canyon, the weather
became mild enough to permit a number of visitors
to ride down the Bright Angel trail, and great
preparations were made for spending the day
and night down below, then coming up by another
trail.</p>

<p>“You never expect to reach the bottom alive,
do you?” demanded Mrs. Alexander, now restored
to her rightful title.</p>

<p>“Why, of course!” retorted Dodo, laughingly.
“It’s just as safe now as in July—and there isn’t
a flake of snow to be had yet, so there is no danger
along the trail. We had a far more dangerous
time on going through the aspen brakes on
Humphrey’s Peak.”</p>

<p>“Well, you foolish people may risk your necks
if you choose, but don’t ask me to do so, too!”
declared Mrs. Alexander.</p>

<p>“You dislike riding, anyway, Ma, so it’s just
as well if you remain above,” returned Dodo,
hoping to be agreeable, yet hailing the news
that her mother would not ride down with
them.</p>

<p>The plan was perfected that evening, and the
guides asked those who wished to take the trip
to be ready in warm riding togs about eight in
the morning. Then, after all was settled, a group
of new arrivals poured into the hotel. With the
strangers, Mrs. Alexander recognized a man
whom she had seen at the Colorado Springs hotel.
He was reputed to be a retired banker from San
Francisco, but he everlastingly played golf while
staying at the resort, and she had had no opportunity
to try her charms to captivate him. Now,
however, he had no chance to play his favorite
game, so she planned to play her own little game
with him.</p>

<p>Hearing that he would be one of the party to
ride down Bright Angel, Mrs. Alexander suddenly
changed her mind and said she, too, had
decided to go with the rest. When she learned
later, that the trip had been extended to take in
Ribbon Falls, and the nights’ rest at Phantom
Ranch, she wavered in her decision.</p>

<p>“How do I know I will have a decent bed at
an old ranchhouse?” wondered she, debating what
would be best to do.</p>

<p>But the impressive appearance of the man she
had watched and admired at the Springs, proved
too much for her dread of going without comforts.
Hence, she was up soon after the call-boy
rapped at her door in the morning, and then she
started to dress herself in a (what she considered)
fetching tourist costume. She was still arranging
her hair, when Dodo knocked upon her
door and called impatiently to her.</p>

<p>“Goodness, Ma! We’re all through breakfast;
it’s time to start, and you’re still prinking
as for a ball! Hurry up!”</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” exclaimed the lady, but she
failed to do so, until a third urgent call from her
daughter brought her forth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney and the girls were clothed in
warm and serviceable riding habits, but Mrs.
Alexander had sacrificed comfort to her desire to
appear stylish. She wore a very youthful and
natty outfit, better adapted to screen work in
Hollywood than a ride to the very bottom of
Grand Canyon in December.</p>

<p>When the other members of the large party
were notified that the tardy one had arrived and
they could get upon the horses, Mrs. Alexander
maneuvered to edge her horse quite close to the
one which carried the man she wished to captivate.
This gentleman, however, paid scanty attention
to any one—he seemed to be thinking seriously
of the beast he had to ride. Finally Mrs.
Alexander played one of her trump cards.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Guide! It would be much pleasanter
for every one in this party if you would introduce
us to each other. Seeing we are to be members
of one large family, as it were, for the next few
days, don’t you think we ought to know by what
names to address each other?”</p>

<p>One of the guides then rode up and introduced
each one in turn, calling that one by name; and the
others signified their delight at being introduced
in this wholesale manner. When the man who
was responsible for Mrs. Alexander’s being one
of the party was introduced as Mr. Atchison, the
others bowed to him. Mrs. Alexander did more,
however; she had, by degrees, worked her beast
over so that she was quite near the magnet to
which she wished to attach herself; then when
Mr. Atchison rode out of line for a moment to be
introduced, she made her horse appear to start
suddenly—thus she urged the animal into the
place just vacated.</p>

<p>Mr. Atchison saw his former place was taken,
and he sat waiting for the next man in turn to be
introduced. Then he took that place, which
brought him directly behind Mrs. Alexander.
This was what she had hoped for, and, having
succeeded in her little trick, she was delighted
with herself.</p>

<p>The signal was given to start down the trail,
and the guides warned every one about keeping
close in the saddles, and letting the mounts seek
their own foothold. No one was to dream of
jumping off while on the down trail, nor were
they to pull up the horses and halt the line behind.
Other advices were given, and then the
long cavalcade passed on its way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander lost no time in following up
the advantage she had secured by taking another’s
place in the line, and she chattered like a magpie
all the way from the hotel to the rim of the
canyon, turning constantly in the saddle to send a
look at her admired follower—literally speaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Atchison had little need to reply, since the
lady kept up a rapid-fire conversation which
called for no answers. The burden of her information
seemed to be about the days spent at
Colorado Springs, when she envied him those
marvelous shots! Had she known that the gentleman
addressed was thinking of other things
while she prattled, she might have changed her
tactics.</p>

<p>When they came to Bright Angel Trail, and
those in front had passed over the rim, Mr. Atchison
suddenly woke up.</p>

<p>“Madam, you’d better keep your face turned
in the direction you’re riding, or you may never
have time to regret the error,” said he, seriously,
seeing Mrs. Alexander’s head turned towards
him.</p>

<p>This silenced her for a time, and she paid
strict attention to the descent, but she planned
at the same time just what she would do when
the party reached the first dismounting place to
rest.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, Mrs. Alexander found, in
all seriousness, enough to think of to keep her
from sending one backward look at Mr. Atchison,
or, indeed, to continue planning what she
might do when the tourists reached Indian Gardens.
Like most shallow persons, she was
dreadfully afraid of hurting herself, or of dying.
Consequently, when her mount seemed to edge
too near the very rim of death, she shrieked
aloud in terror, or tried to drive the wise horse
closer to the wall. The result of these frantic
actions were shown in torn skirts, skinned thighs
and scraped boots, where she rubbed against the
flinty walls of the Canyon.</p>

<p>After many trying incidents for Mrs. Alexander,
and the impatient advices forced from Mr.
Atchison, who considered the hysterical woman
would have been better off in bed than on this
trip, they reached Indian Gardens and were glad
to get out of the saddles and relax.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander instantly fastened herself to
her latest “ideal,” by taking his arm and thanking
him profusely for his care and concern over
her on the way thus far. She gazed, with what
she fondly believed to be a soulful look, up into
his face, and he, prosaic man, laughed aloud at
her gushing manner.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear woman, I only warned you of
dangers, because it would be so unpleasant to
have the whole crowd depressed by having you
slide out of sight over the rim of the trail. I
came here with my friends to enjoy myself, not to
attend a post mortem. And I earnestly advise
you to remain here at the Gardens, until we return
up-trail and take you back,” suggested Mr. Atchison.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander failed to hear the sarcasm in
the speech, and she may have continued her blandishments
had the gentleman not released his arm
by wriggling it away from her hold and instantly
excusing himself. He then hurried over to the
place where the guides were preparing luncheon
for the party, and there he seemed deeply engaged
in conversing with two of them. Mrs. Alexander
watched and saw him pass a bill to one of the
men, and the two guides addressed nodded their
heads, and, grinning, seemed to agree to a proposition.</p>

<p>Mr. Atchison then mingled with others, and
found his friends with whom he had arrived at
the hotel late the night before. Dodo and her
friends now joined Mrs. Alexander so that she
had no new opportunity to appeal to her beau-ideal.</p>

<p>After the rest period had passed, the guides
called all to mount once more. One guide seemed
to have difficulty in adjusting the saddle on Mrs.
Alexander’s horse, and this delayed her in finding
her place in the line. It became necessary for
the guide to call another one to aid him in fastening
the straps, and, finally, Mrs. Alexander found
she would have to ride at the very end of the
line; one of the guides, now attending to her saddle-straps,
being the last member of the party.
The other guide was just in advance of her.</p>

<p>“Why! this isn’t my place, at all!” cried Mrs.
Alexander, angrily, seeing Mr. Atchison riding
with his friends.</p>

<p>“There are no reserved places, Madam,” replied
the guide.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander turned to look at the man,
and then she recognized the guide who had taken
the money from Mr. Atchison.</p>

<p>“That’s what you <i>say</i>, but how about selling
places?” snapped she, beginning to understand
that the man she wished to captivate had purchased
his way out of her reach.</p>

<p>“Beware, Madam! Your mount is slipping
while you twist and turn like this,” exclaimed the
guide, warningly.</p>

<p>Since the animals had started on the down trail
again, there was nothing to be done about recovering her first place in the line. But Mrs. Alexander
was not one to be so readily turned from
her object. If she could not succeed in one way,
she would try in other ways. And there was no
one to warn Mr. Atchison of this.</p>

<p>Just below Indian Gardens the leading guide
turned off the Bright Angel Trail and followed
the Tonto Trail, which led down to the bottom of
the Canyon, and finally, known as the Kaibab
Trail, ran across the Colorado, via the great
suspension bridge. Farther on they reached
Phantom Ranch, which was located in Bright
Angel Canyon.</p>

<p>The trip had been most enjoyable to every one
but that one who had a chip upon her shoulder.
And finally, when the party dismounted at Phantom
Ranch for the night, they were tired from
the long ride, but eager to enjoy supper and an
evening indoors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had planned to square herself
with Mr. Atchison that evening, but she was so
worn out from riding all day that the unusual
exercise made her only too glad to crawl into
bed. She ordered her supper sent to her room,
and she also commandeered a maid to rub her
aching bones with liniment. That proved to be
an unusual bonanza for the servant, because Mrs.
Alexander never was niggardly in rewarding dependents,
and this girl had eased her distress to
such a degree that she lavished money upon her
in return.</p>

<p>Early the following morning the guides roused
their party and urged them to make haste and
get along the trail again. Mrs. Alexander found
herself so stiff and sore, however, that she could
not get up. Try as she would to move her joints
and make her limbs obey her order, she found
she lacked power to do so. Hence it was found
that she would have to remain at Phantom
Ranch that day and rest in order to continue
back up-trail to El Tovar Hotel the next morning.</p>

<p>Naturally she rebelled against nature’s demand,
and she proved she could be a disagreeable
guest. But Mr. Atchison had acquitted himself
bravely, as well he might, seeing he was to be
freed from tiresome attentions all that day.</p>

<p>In a spirit of mischief, as well as of freedom,
he sent a large box of bon bons and several magazines
to Mrs. Alexander’s room with his card,
upon which he wrote “regrets.”</p>

<p>Of course, Mrs. Alexander decided that the
gentleman was heart-broken because she would
not be with him that day, and she smiled, even as
she groaned with aching bones; then she turned
to open the box of candy.</p>

<p>The season for crowds of tourists having long
been passed, the Ranch host had not stocked up
with fresh bon bons. The box sent to Mrs.
Alexander had been discovered back upon a shelf
of the cupboard, and no one knew how long it had
been hiding there. Consequently, the first bite in
the chocolate-covered cocoanut bar caused Mrs.
Alexander to get rid of it quicker than she had
bitten into it. The cocoanut had soured, and the
lady was finicky about her candies.</p>

<p>That box of sweets proved to be as genuine a
failure as the love-affair Mrs. Alexander had
planned between the donor of the bon bons and
herself. With a deep sigh, she now turned her
attention to the magazines. Here, at least, she
would find pastime in whiling away the lonesome
hours that day!</p>

<p>The first magazine she took up was the
Popular Science Monthly, having, as advertised,
all the pictures of recent inventions and scientific
discoveries. This periodical she flung across the
room—what had she in common with such stuff!</p>

<p>The second magazine was found to be the
Literary Digest. But it was several months old,
and not an item in it about fashions or society
gossip! This paper followed the first magazine—across
the room.</p>

<p>The third and last copy turned out to be a
more fortunate choice of literature for this lady.
It was a popular love-story magazine, but it had
been well-thumbed by guests during the year it
had been upon the table of the inn, and Mrs.
Alexander scrutinized its torn pages doubtfully,
as she turned them over daintily.</p>

<p>Desire overcame doubt, however, and soon she
was gloating over the success of a beautiful young
shop-girl who had won an earl’s son for her husband.
This was the kind of “literature” Mrs.
Alexander preferred, and she forgot her aches
and loneliness, while devouring the romances of
impossible lovers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Polly and her friends reached Ribbon
Falls, and enjoyed the trip immensely. Mr.
Atchison found Mrs. Courtney and her charges
very agreeable, and the two parties became very
friendly before they started on the return ride
to the Ranch where they would spend the second
night.</p>

<p>The weather continued warm and delightful,
and the guides declared they had never known
such a prolonged Indian Summer since the beginning
of the World War. If it remained warm
and temperate as it was then they would be able
to conduct visitors down the trails of the Canyon
all winter.</p>

<p>Mr. Atchison showed a marked preference for
Mrs. Courtney’s society that day, and Polly
nudged her friends to have them watch the grey-haired
man singe his heart at the flame.</p>

<p>“Not much flame about Mrs. Courtney,” retorted
Jack, laughing at Polly’s remark.</p>

<p>“Well, I used that saying because it is common,
but I suppose I should have said he’d freeze his
heart at the ice-berg,” was her laughing correction.</p>

<p>“That’s better!” agreed Eleanor. “Any one
who can resist the attractions of our Dalky, as
Mrs. Courtney has done, must have a cake of ice
where her heart should be.”</p>

<p>“That remains to be seen,” remarked Dodo,
wisely. “There hasn’t been opportunity for the
two to get acquainted this trip, but wait till this
mining scheme ends, then we shall see!”</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, let that grey-haired man keep
your friend in practise, eh?” chuckled Jack,
watching the man who was so attentive to the
lady under discussion.</p>

<p>On the ride back to the Ranch, Mr. Atchison
hovered about Mrs. Courtney, and when, at last,
they rode up to the house, he insisted upon helping
her out of the saddle, and then assisting her
to the porch.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had dressed late that afternoon,
and was waiting for the return of the riders,
hurrying out to the porch the moment she heard
the hoofs of the horses. She was just in time to
see her whilom beau smile foolishly at Mrs.
Courtney’s thanks, and then she fixed him with
her eye.</p>

<p>“I trust you had a pleasant ride, Mrs. Courtney,”
began Mrs. Alexander, still staring the mature
admirer out of countenance. “I preferred
the solitude of this ranch to the troublesome attention
of elderly men! I had quite enough of
that ridiculous sort of nonsense on the ride down.
What a pity old men never know when they are
passé!”</p>

<p>With this thrust, Mrs. Alexander took Mrs.
Courtney’s arm and led her safely away from the
“nonsense” of passé admirers.</p>

</h2>

<p>The Dalken party rested the day after the return
to the hotel, and then, the day following
that, Jack had the guides take them down the
Hermit Trail. Mrs. Alexander refused emphatically
to risk her precious life again on such silly
errands as those leading to the bottom of the
Canyon, only to have to ride up again!</p>

<p>They stopped over night at the Hermit Cabins,
and then back-trailed until they reached the
Tonto Trail where it forks from the Hermit
Trail. The Tonto Trail led them along the
Colorado River, but necessarily swerving in and
out between the huge peaks. Late that afternoon
they came to Bright Angel Trail, and thus regained
the upper level once more. It was quite
dark by the time they entered the hotel, and, at
first, the lights dazzled their eyes so that they
did not see who was standing beside Mrs. Alexander. In a few moments, however, Polly gave a
glad squeal and rushed forward.</p>

<p>“Oh, Dalky! I’m <i>so</i> glad to see you again.
When did you get here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken was immediately surrounded by
the bevy of young people, so that he found it impossible
to reply to all their questions at once.
Turning to Polly, he answered her.</p>

<p>“We arrived not half an hour ago, and Mrs.
Alexander was just telling us about that dreadful
trip down to Phantom Ranch. I only wish I had
been there, to try to encourage you when you
feared instant death over the rim of Bright Angel.
Mrs. Alexander says the trail got its name
from the many lives which are being sacrificed
while trying to go up or down that perpendicular
path.” Mr. Dalken’s face showed no hint of a
smile as he spoke, but Dodo laughed outright.</p>

<p>“Why, Ma! I should think you’d try to keep
your fears to yourself,” exclaimed the girl. “As
for telling any one how the trail got its name—that
is too absurd for anything! Some one has
been stringing you, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I reckon I ought to know, young lady!”
snapped Dodo’s mother. “Mr. Atchison is very
well-informed, and he spent more than an hour
this morning before he left, in telling me all about
Grand Canyon and how the trails got their various
names.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Atchison tried to see just how much hot
air you would take,” chuckled Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“Ebeneezer! I told you a few minutes ago that
you must not treat me as you have in the past.
I realize how far above you I am in my ideals
and social polish, and I demand recognition of my
station,” was Mrs. Alexander’s severe reprimand.</p>

<p>Her husband failed to be impressed by her
hauteur, however, and his laugh echoed through
the room. In fact, it was so spontaneous and contagious
that all the others in the group—except
Mrs. Alexander, of course—had to smile with
him.</p>

<p>“Well, well, girls! Come sit down and hear
our story,” interrupted Mr. Dalken, eager to silence
these two bickering partners. And that invitation
instantly changed the trend of thought.</p>

<p>“Now, begin at the very beginning, Dalky—when
you-all left us at Flagstaff and rushed away
without telling us where, or who with, or when
you’d get back,” coaxed Polly, eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right, then,” agreed Mr. Dalken. “In
the parlance of the fairy tales, I’ll say: ‘Once upon
a time there were three wise men who went to a
far-off land to seek their fortunes.’” The narrator
smiled as he indicated Mr. Fuzzier, Mr.
Alexander and himself. “Well, these wise men
thought they had reached the land of their
dreams without others being aware of their coming.
But they were to learn that not only had
certain individuals in Chicago telegraphed the
advent of these wise men to certain individuals
in and near the section of country where the three
friends were going to take fortune by the forelock,
but they discovered also that every movement
since they left Chicago until they were on the
drive from Flagstaff to Sedona was known to those
who were waiting with their nets wide open to
entrap the unwary, innocent, gullible, wise men.”</p>

<p>The girls giggled at Mr. Dalken’s latter part
of the tale, but Polly interpolated: “Oh, do speak
in simple English, Dalky! The story is going to
be too thrilling for round-about methods.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. Seeing you prefer unvarnished
facts to classic lore, here goes,” was the
smiling rejoinder. “Jack, there, secured a most
valuable chauffeur for us,—but this was quite unintentional
on his part,—the morning we started
from Flagstaff. In fact, we could not have had a
better man for our purpose, than the driver of
the car that sped us along the trail to Montezumas
Castle.</p>

<p>“Bill Beldon, that’s the chauffeur’s name, seemed
to have a hunch that we needed speed to reach
the old Farview Ranch before Father Time could
arrive there. So he kept his foot upon the gas
without letting up, until we struck a spread of
gravel and that introduced our vicissitudes.
First Alex. ran up against a bit of gravel as large
as his head, and, his head being softer than the
stone, he showed results in a vast swelling. Then
Fuzzy tried to dent the car with his forehead,
and immediately <i>his</i> head began to puff up. I
waited for a better opportunity to dent something,
and I found it while stooping over Alex.
Unfortunately for us both, the chauffeur tried
the same stunt at the same time. Result: two
more swelled heads. Now, girls, picture us four
men, each one nursing a great black and blue
lump about the size of an orange!”</p>

<p>At the mental picture portrayed, every one
present laughed merrily; then Jack added: “I bet
you won out in your plans, or you wouldn’t sit
there giving us the funny details of the first stage
of the trip.”</p>

<p>“Jack, my boy, you are too bright for your
age,” commented Mr. Fuzzier. Mr. Dalken paid
no heed, but resumed his story.</p>

<p>“While we were trying to stand Alex. upon his
feet, Bill explained how he had learned who we
were, and how a man by the name of Dunlap had
been anxiously waiting for us at Williams, where
he thought we must appear on the way to Grand
Canyon. He also told us how the chauffeur of
Dunlap’s hired car, Jim, by name, was a chum
of his, and how Jim had driven Dunlap to Flagstaff
twice that week to study the register of the
hotel and assure himself that his quarry had not
been there, and, perhaps, escaped him by another
way.</p>

<p>“That was all we needed to make us forget
heads and tires, and we urged Bill to get busy with
the gas, or he’d be a dead man.</p>

<p>“Needless to add, Fuzzy, here, assuaged the
driver’s grief over the damage the car would be
sure to receive on that reckless trip from the main
road to Sedona, by promising him two new cars—or
the price of them—if he got us to the ranch
before others woke up to the fact that we were
within a hundred miles of it.</p>

<p>“Well, Bill Beldon won his prize money, but
it was touch and go at the last. I’m anticipating
the finale of the tale in order to quiet Jack’s
nerves—I see he wants to know if we won out.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried Jack, clapping his hands at
the news. “That means you go on with the South
American project, and I can go down there with
the rest of the men to work on the development.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken smiled indulgently, for he thought
he knew Jack well enough to believe him incapable
of serious application to work of any kind. Then
he continued his story.</p>

<p>“We left the main road, as I said, and were
heading for Sedona, when Bill struck this gravel
stretch. The car behind had a good opportunity
now to catch up and pass us by, but the road was
too narrow to permit two cars abreast. Besides,
our car, in striking the deep rut, had turned
partly across the road, thus obstructing it for any
other vehicles. All the same, we saw the driver,
Jim, driving along swiftly, and we were determined
to evade his passenger, Dunlap.</p>

<p>“We bundled Alex. back into the car, and in
another moment Bill was in his seat. By the time
Fuzzy and I were inside, the car had started
again, and we soon out-distanced the car behind.</p>

<p>“We decided not to pass through Sedona, after
all, but we tried to keep on the outskirts in order
to avoid attention. From there we determined
to strike in a southwesterly direction towards
Camp Verde. The ranch we were after was half-way
between Sedona and Verde, and we would
have to go a bit off of our route in order to
travel on ready-made trails.</p>

<p>“All went well for us,—even the tires held out
better than we had expected them to do,—until
we came to a crosstrail that struck in from
Clarkdale. Just before we reached the point
where the trail veered off to the great ranch for
which we were bound, Bill spied a third car coming
from the direction of Clarkdale. As it was
going at top speed, he concluded that it had passengers
who thought time must be worth money.
So he drew our attention to it.</p>

<p>“‘We take no chances, Bill!’ I ordered. ‘It
may be a second Dunlap in that car. Anyway,
shoot ahead, and keep in the lead, no matter if
the whole works go to pieces a moment after we
reach the ranch.’</p>

<p>“And Bill did shoot ahead. In fact, we made
the turn to the ranch about fifty yards in advance
of the automobile coming from Clarkdale.</p>

<p>“The ranch buildings could be seen in the far
distance like so many tiny dots upon the landscape,
when our next delay came about. One of
the rear tires blew up. Bill gazed anxiously out
to see how much advanced time he might take
and yet keep in the lead of the pursuing car. No
other automobile was to be seen, so we all
jumped out, jacked the car, and worked like college
football players at a crack game. You’d
hardly believe it, if we were to tell you the time it
took us to change tires and get started again.
Just as Alex. slammed the door of the automobile,
I peeped out and saw the car from Clarkdale
coming into view on the trail.</p>

<p>“Then, even as I was about to turn my gaze
away, I saw the car skid, and in another moment
it had climbed up the side of the bank that skirted
the trail. It toppled over against the high side
of the embankment; that was fortunate for us, as
we could not have been heartless enough to leave
an injured competitor upon a lonely trail had
the car rolled over on the downward side and
turned turtle.</p>

<p>“We had gone another mile, when Alex., who
was posted at the rear window watching the trail
behind, reported that another car was coming
along the trail, and the man who had been in the
overturned automobile was hailing the chauffeur
to stop. In another moment, Alex. said: ‘Now
they’ve stopped, and the man is getting in the
other car. Now they are on their way again.
But we have a fine lead on them.’</p>

<p>“He had no more than finished speaking, when
the front tire went flat. I shouted to Bill to keep
right on running on the flat tire, if necessary, since
it was not far now to the ranch buildings.</p>

<p>“But the flat tire delayed us in the race, and the
jolting was dreadful. In fact, when we pulled
up in front of the one-story shack where we were
to meet the man who had the legal right to sign
an option for the property, we were completely
out of breath from the shaking up. We had
reached our destination, however, five minutes in
advance of the other men, and Bill had earned his
reward.</p>

<p>“Then I ran to the closed door, and banged
away at it. No one answered, and I tried the
handle. The door was locked! Then we ran
about the place, Fuzzy to the sheds, Alex. to the
back of the shanty, and I to try a window to get
in. All to no purpose! Not a soul could we
find, and no notice, either, to state where the
owner might have gone.</p>

<p>“To our chagrin the other automobile now
pulled up in the clearing before the shack, and
Jim greeted his pal, Bill Beldon. We stood eyeing
the occupants of the car, as they prepared to
get out, and there, to our astonishment, we saw
Algy step from the inside. He appeared to be so
frightened, and so shaken up, that he could not
speak to any one for a time. Two men followed
directly after him, and they came forward without
ceremony to introduce themselves to us.</p>

<p>“‘Is this the party from Chicago?’ asked the
man whom we suspected to be Dunlap.</p>

<p>“‘Why do you ask?’ I demanded impatiently,
realizing how we had missed the option on the
place by having the owner break his appointment.</p>

<p>“‘Because I must be sure I am addressing the
right party before I tell my story,’ explained Dunlap.</p>

<p>“‘And how about the man with you?’ asked
Fuzzy. ‘He came from the opposite direction,
and but for the accident to his car, would have
reached here just ahead of you. Now he is with
you.’</p>

<p>“‘Yes; I was greatly surprised to find Mr. Belnord
in the vicinity of the ranch, because I had
reason to believe him at Williams, where I left
him the day I started for Flagstaff,’ explained
the man addressed.</p>

<p>“‘Then you make no secret of having tried to
anticipate our arrival at Flagstaff, and keeping
yourself posted in regard to our appearance at
Williams?’ questioned Fuzzy, with a meaning
smile.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, indeed, no! That is, if you are the
three gentlemen for whom I have instructions,’
returned the man.</p>

<p>“‘What do you mean—instructions for us?’
asked Alex.</p>

<p>“‘Why, didn’t you get the telegram I sent to
Mr. Fuzzier in Chicago?’ asked both men, anxiously.
Then one added: ‘One of you three gentlemen
must be Mr. Fuzzier, I trust?’</p>

<p>“‘Well, yes! I am the man,’ confessed
Fuzzy.</p>

<p>“‘And one of you must be the Mr. Dalken of
New York, whom we wish to see, and the third
one is Mr. Alexander, of Denver?’</p>

<p>“‘Seeing that we happen to be these three men,
what is it you wish of us?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ began the man who had been toppled
over in the automobile, ‘I am Mr. Belnord, executor
of the man who owned this great tract of
land. I found, in his sheaf of papers, that he
had corresponded with you gentlemen about an
option on this land. And he further said, that he
wished you to have first choice on buying the
place, because Ebeneezer Alexander had befriended
him years ago while both men were at
Cripple Creek staking out claims. It seems this
Alexander had staked a rich claim, and had advised
my client to stake the adjoining claim. He
did so, and cleared up enough on that advice to
buy this great ranch.’</p>

<p>“‘And I am Mr. Dunlap, the agent who sold
Sam White this ranch. I happen to know that
Sam always suspected his property of having a
rich vein of copper in it, and we often planned
what we would do some day, if Sam got over his
rheumatism and could work. Poor Sam died two
weeks ago, and Mr. Belnord and I have been on
the lookout for you gentlemen ever since. We
both had wires from your offices in Chicago and
New York, informing us that you would be on
your way to Grand Canyon by the time the messages
reached us. And we posted ourselves at
the two main towns on the railroad, thinking you
might get off to have a look at the sights on the
way.’</p>

<p>“‘When Dunlap and I heard you had gone on
to the ranch, we both started after you, hoping
to save you the long, hard drive over these dreadful
trails. But you’ve got one fast driver, in that
Bill Beldon,’ explained Mr. Belnord.</p>

<p>“At that, we three stared speechlessly at the
two men. I managed to get my breath, however,
and then asked: ‘Do you two mean to tell us that
you were trying to locate us in order to help us
take up the option on this land?’</p>

<p>“‘Why, of course! What did you think we
wanted of you?’ asked Mr. Dunlap.</p>

<p>“At that, we had to laugh at ourselves, but
Bill Beldon stood looking glum. He feared he
would lose that reward, because he had misinterpreted
the intentions of the man Dunlap.</p>

<p>“‘I will confess, gentlemen,’ added Mr. Dunlap,
after we had exhausted our laughing-stock,
‘that I had my own axe to grind, as well as seeing
you get possession of this land. I bought a great
tract of land adjoining White’s ranch, because of
my faith in his powers of discernment. And I
thought, perhaps, if you were interested in taking
up Sam’s ranch, you would also like to look over
my tract at the same time. I want to get into a
big developing scheme, and I have a little cash to
add to the value of my land, if you will consider
me as one of your stock-holders. So, now, gentlemen,
suppose we get down to business.’</p>

<p>“Well, friends! That’s the story of how we
‘Three Wise Fools’ ran ourselves across the country
in search of a paper that was right at hand
in the little town from which we started. And
all the time we thought we were running away
from our competitors, we actually were running
away from the two men who were anxious to
help us realize our wishes.” Mr. Dalken laughed
as he concluded.</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” exclaimed Polly, delightedly.</p>

<p>“And you got all you went after?” asked
Eleanor.</p>

<p>“More! And we need not have gone so far
to get it, either,” replied Mr. Fuzzier.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dalken’s name for you three seems most
appropriate,” laughed Mrs. Courtney, “but your
wooden shoe was an automobile, and the sea you
sailed was the ranch-land. Now, however, we are
glad to find you have sailed safely back to harbor.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for that, Fair Lady,” smiled Mr.
Dalken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander had no idea of what Mrs.
Courtney had been referring to when she spoke
of the wooden shoe and the sailing over the
sea, and she felt that she must add a word
now.</p>

<p>“I was not told that Ebeneezer and you two
other men wore wooden shoes on that trip to the
ranch, but that doesn’t concern <i>me</i>, if you prefer
to wear sores on your feet. What does concern
me, however, is Mr. Belnord. Where did you
leave the gentleman who was so attentive to me
during my stop-over at Williams?”</p>

<p>“Why, Maggie, you’ll find him back in Chicago,
by this time, I hope. We sent him on at once to
attend to all the papers concerning our transaction,”
explained Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“And what did you do with my poor Algy?”
demanded the lady.</p>

<p>“Your Algy is still mooning around Williams,
waiting as you commanded him to do,” chuckled
Mr. Alexander.</p>

<p>“You didn’t leave him there, did you, and come
on to Grand Canyon, where you knew I would
be?” exclaimed his wife.</p>

<p>“Algy is of age, and he was afraid to disobey
you, Maggie, dear! You’ve got him trained better than I ever was,” retorted her independent
husband.</p>

<p>“My poor, dear Algy!” sighed Mrs. Alexander,
leaving the group and going to the desk to
wire at once for her obedient admirer to join her
at Grand Canyon.</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken and his party remained at the
Grand Canyon two days longer, and then started
for Prescott, where they would stop at the leading
hotel until Mr. Belnord returned from Chicago
with the signed papers for the three investors.</p>

<p>So interested were the members of the Dalken
party on the way from Grand Canyon, that they
arrived at Williams before they were aware of it.
Here they were to change for Ash Fork, and
at that town they would change again for the
train which ran to Prescott.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Alexander and Algy sat in the seat together,
they heard the guard announce Williams.
Algy heaved a heartfelt sigh, and then said:
“Shall I eveh forget this place? I felt I had been
deserted by my best and only friend!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t act as though you felt that way,”
retorted his “best and only friend.” “I came
here for you, and you had motored with that man
to the ranch. That’s how you broke your heart
over being here alone.”</p>

<p>“Aw, don’t say that, Mrs. Alexandeh, because
you do not know how the fellaw coaxed me to
go and keep him company,” explained Algy.</p>

<p>There was no time to say more at that time,
since all had to hurry to change cars. And Algy’s
shallow mind soon forgot the complaint he had
to make in exoneration of his leaving Williams.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander maintained a dignified silence
all the rest of the train-ride to Prescott, because
she felt that Algy must be trained to realize that
she was the one to order and plan. Algy, never-the-less,
seemed not to miss her conversation because
he was preoccupied in watching Jack and
the girls.</p>

<p>The three days spent in sight-seeing around
Prescott were enjoyable ones, and the entire party
also made trips to many points a distance from
the town. The roads were excellent, and the
weather continued as mild as though it were summer
instead of December. One of the auto trips
made at that time was along the Cherry Creek
road, thence along the Rio Verde to Camp Verde.</p>

<p>From Camp Verde, Mr. Dalken had the chauffeurs drive them on to Crown King, where he
wished to inspect certain parcels of land offered
for sale. As the vicinity of Crown King had recently
developed rich mineral deposits, it behooved
these careful investors to examine the
truth of such reports.</p>

<p>Mr. Belnord arrived in Prescott the evening of
the third day of the Dalken’s party visit there.
The success of his trip to Chicago made a gala
night of his appearance with the recorded deeds,
and the elderly men of the party joined in the
dancing with the younger generation with such
vim that they soon wilted.</p>

<p>During the next two days at the hotel, a budget
of letters arrived for the members of the touring
party. These letters had been forwarded from
one place to another all along the line, and now,
ten days later, they were delivered to the right
persons.</p>

<p>Polly received more personal letters than any
one of her friends, but then, it was remembered
that Tom would be sure to mail her a letter every
day, even though it contained but the one oft-repeated
sentiment: “I love you. Will you marry
me, Polly?” These easily recognized letters were
left to the very last, however, and Polly eagerly
read the communications from her friends in the
East.</p>

<p>“Oh, girls, <i>girls</i>!” exclaimed she, having read
half through one of her New York letters.
“Guess the news—it’s wonderful!”</p>

<p>“What—oh, what is it?” demanded several
voices, their owners looking expectantly at Polly.</p>

<p>“Why, Nancy Fabian is engaged to Raymond
Ames—the chum Jack brought aboard the yacht
at Palm Beach, during our southern cruise, you
know!” exclaimed Polly, aware of the importance
of her news.</p>

<p>“No! You don’t mean to tell me that Ray is
such a ninny as to fall in love with a girl!” was
Jack’s disgusted comment.</p>

<p>“Of course not!” retorted Eleanor, quickly.
“It’s poor Nancy who is the goose. To think of
such a brilliant, talented girl throwing herself
away upon a mere young man! Now, if this
friend of Jack’s had anything to recommend him
other than his acquaintance with a ne’er-do-well
that we all know too well, but whom we will not
mention, it might be pardonable. But to see
<i>Nancy</i> choose Ray!”</p>

<p>“Umph!” snorted Jack, highly indignant at her
tone. “I bet anything you girls would just give
your heads to have an offer of marriage from
such a good-looking chap. <i>I</i> know some girls who
would like to catch <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p>“Oh, hark! The little vanity bag!” laughed
Dodo.</p>

<p>The others joined in the laugh, as much at her
comparison as at her contagious laughter.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, there is hope that Nancy may
be saved from taking the fatal step in matrimony,”
mused Polly, glancing at the letter in her
hand. “She writes that there is no idea of her
marrying in the near future, but Ray and she decided
to announce an engagement to stop every
one from asking them ‘when is it to be?’”</p>

<p>“I just want to see any one drive me to such
extremes by asking impertinent questions. I’d
tell them mighty quick just where they get off!”
declared Dodo, tossing her head.</p>

<p>“Good reason why you’d like to see them ask
you,” teased Jack.</p>

<p>This second hint from him brought down an
avalanche of protests from the three girls—as he
knew it would. He dearly loved to tease them,
and nothing pleased him better than to have them
all defending themselves at one time.</p>

<p>“You certainly have a bad memory, Jack Baxter!” exclaimed Eleanor. “I can remember, not
many years ago, when you fell in love with first
one and then the other one of us girls. When
you got the mitten from Polly, you threatened to
commit suicide. But you merely took a trip to
Pebbly Pit. Then you began again, and fell in
love with me. I soon showed you the exit, however!
And you next tried the game on Dodo.
She felt sorry for you, and told you in a gentle
manner that she would prefer to be your sister.
But, at that time, she had no idea of what a
wretched brother you’d make. Now you’re willing
to fall in love with any girl who’ll look at you—only
they won’t look your way!”</p>

<p>While Eleanor had unburdened her heart of
this long complaint, Polly had hastily opened
Tom’s last letter. As she had expected, she
found his letter wound up with his usual proposal.
She waved the letter defiantly under Jack’s nose,
and then added: “There, you conceited child!
Don’t tell us we never have an offer from a beau.
Here’s one in this letter—and I can marry the
man any day I care to speak the word. In fact,
he’d follow me all the way to China, if I said I’d
marry him in Pekin!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you mean Tom Latimer,” returned Jack.
“We all know <i>he</i> doesn’t mean what he says. He
is so used to proposing now, that he does it from
force of habit. If you were to write and tell
him you’d consider his offer, he’d soon back down
in some way.”</p>

<p>“Why!” gasped Polly, frowning at Jack. “I’d
just like to shake you till your teeth rattled.”</p>

<p>Jack roared. He hadn’t enjoyed himself so
much in a long time. “My teeth can’t rattle.
Poll. They’re set in too firmly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go along with you!” cried Dodo, jumping
up and catching the torment by the shoulders
and wheeling him right-about-face and then
marching him from the room.</p>

<p>Jack found Dodo’s muscle too much for him,
and he had to make a graceful, though forced,
exit. When he heard the key turn in the lock of
the door, he hurried to the desk and asked the
clerk to kindly ascertain why it was that that reception
room door was locked.</p>

<p>Naturally the clerk was amazed at such temerity
in any one stopping at the hotel, and he hastened
to demand that the door be opened at once!
The three girls, believing Jack was knocking and
demanding entrance, refused to unlock the door.
Consequently, the clerk went for a pass-key and
in a short time had the door wide open. When
the two sides—the girls and the clerk—faced each
other, the truth came out, and Jack was destined
to have a trick played upon him to square accounts
with the girls.</p>

<p>Other letters from friends at Pebbly Pit and
from New York were received by the members
of Mr. Dalken’s party, and then Mr. Dalken sat
down to reply to those which he had received
from Mr. Ashby that day. After telling him of
the successful issue of his attempt to secure the
valuable mining land near the competing copper
company’s vast lands, he went on to speak of
the strides the new corporation, called “South
American Interior Developing Company,” were
making. Then he spoke of his future plans.</p>

<p>“You see, Ashby, the terrific earthquake in
Japan has made a visit to the Orient out of the
question at present. Now the question is: Have
your friends in New York thought of any place
you might choose for next summer’s vacationing,
instead of Japan?</p>

<p>“Since we are all so far west, and will be in
California after Christmas and during the following
three months, I am inclined to take that President
Harding trip to Alaska—that is, I think it
would be splendid to visit the same places he saw,
and do Alaska thoroughly, before we go outside
of our own country.</p>

<p>“If the Fabians and you with your family
started for San Francisco in April, I will have
completed all my business visits by that time, and
we could lease a small steamer or yacht, and sail
leisurely northward. We could stop whenever
we pleased, as we did upon the trip to the West
Indies, and down the coast of South America.
We could follow the pathway now so well
known, because our honored President passed
that way to Alaska, and we might go farther inland,
and northward, to look over the mining industries
there. It ought to give us many valuable
points on the wisdom of selecting mining
equipment for our South American work.</p>

<p>“We would have at least three to four months
in which to enjoy this trip, but I will say that I see
little hope of your finding any goods whatever
suitable for your Decorating Shops. This time it
will be a genuine rest for you—and you need it,
old man!</p>

<p>“We can be back in San Francisco by the last
week of August, and you can devote a little time
then to looking up the latest imports from the
Orient, in California. You may find enough rare
bargains to make it worth coming on such a long
trip.</p>

<p>“I am writing the Fabians to-night, also, and
you two families can get together and talk things
over, then write and let me know your final decision.
Remember, however, that we ought to
start for Alaska not later than May, if we hope
to have a good visit there and get back in San
Francisco by the last of August.</p>

<p>“If you folks should decide to travel by the
Canadian Pacific road and meet us in Seattle, you
must give us ample time in which to change our
plans to meet you there. It will matter little to
me whether it be San Francisco or Seattle, just as
long as you give me plenty of notice.</p>

<p>“The Colombian Development plan is going
ahead splendidly, and Fuzzier plans to take Alexander
with him to visit the territory for which
he has options. They will sail from San Francisco
as soon as we arrive there, and expect to be
in South America the greater part of the next six
months.”</p>

<p>Having concluded his letters to his friends in
New York, Mr. Dalken walked to the mail-box
to post them. Here he met Polly about to mail a
letter she had just finished.</p>

<p>“Dalky, did you say anything about Tom Latimer
going to South America with Fuzzy and
Dodo’s father?” asked Polly.</p>

<p>“No, I was not aware that Tom is expected to
join us again,” replied Mr. Dalken. “I thought
his huff seemed to be permanent.”</p>

<p>“I am not aware of his intentions either,” admitted
Polly, “but I heard him telling my brother
that he’d love to go with the men who would visit
Colombia to take up the options on that land.”</p>

<p>“Well, if that is so, I’ll write and invite him to
come on and meet us in Los Angeles, and then he
can join Fuzzier and Alexander on their trip,” remarked
Mr. Dalken. But he wondered what
Polly meant by this unusual reference to Tom.
Had he dreamed that she had been peeved by
Jack, when he had said the girls could not find
any wise young man to propose to them, he would
have laughed at her. Polly had been spoiled during
the past two years, by having so many admirers
wait upon her; and now, barring Jack’s indifferent
attentions, having no young man hovering
about, made her miss her faithful beau. Perhaps this lack of attention caused her to write an
unusually kind letter to Tom. But she did not
mention the possibility of his coming to join the
two men who planned to go on to South America—she
left that to Dalky, because she had no desire
to be held responsible for Tom, after he
should arrive in California.</p>

<p>Eleanor had received a letter that day, too, but
she had not mentioned it to any one. It had
been forwarded from New York, the day after
the tourists left that city for the west. Then it
went to Oak Creek, and there it was sent on to the
Denver hotel. Again it had been forwarded to
Santa Fé, and then to Albuquerque. It reached
Gallup the same day Eleanor left there, but it
was not forwarded to Flagstaff for several days,
and when it did arrive at the latter place, Eleanor
had just gone to Grand Canyon. Now it reached
her with its envelope covered with postmarks,
and the original address almost obliterated. But
the girl flushed as she recognized Paul Stewart’s
scrawly writing.</p>

<p>Slipping the letter inside her blouse, she waited
an opportunity to get away where she might read
it undisturbed by others. Now she had this opportunity,
and she made the most of it.</p>

<p>She hastily opened the sealed envelope and
smiled as she found the familiar scrawl that covered
a double sheet of paper. As she read how
Paul had succeeded in his engineering work in the
Rockies of Southern Colorado, she felt proud of
him and his fight against poverty. He went on to
say that all he needed now was the big opportunity
to prove what was in him. When that
chance came, he was ready to take it by the forelock,
and as soon as he had made good his claims,
he would be making tracks in the direction of a
certain girl he knew—one who thought nothing
of money, but a lot of a real man! “Still,” wrote
Paul, “I cannot ask that girl to have me unless
I have something more than brag to prove what
I am capable of doing. In case you hear our old
friend Dalken mention any plans he may have on
the board where a wide-awake mining engineer
is needed, I trust you will not forget to recommend
your devoted lover and soon-to-be husband.”</p>

<p>Eleanor gasped at this daring signature, but
she rather enjoyed such a high-handed manner.
Now she remembered that Mr. Fuzzier and
Dodo’s father were planning to go to South
America as soon as they reached California. And
she lost no time in driving a wedge for Paul to
accompany them on this trip.</p>

<p>She opened the subject nearest her heart that
evening, and began by asking Mr. Dalken how
many men might be allowed to go with the two
men.</p>

<p>“Why do you ask? Polly wants to get rid of
one admirer, and I suppose you have another one
to get rid of, eh?” laughed he.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it!” retorted Eleanor. “But this
one is a wonderful engineer, and he has an exceptional
position in South Colorado at the present
time. However, I might persuade him to give
that up, if we could show him any advantage in
going to South America with our friends.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken smiled. He was good at guessing,
and he guessed Eleanor’s secret. However, he
understood her reluctance to admit any interest
in Paul Stewart, and he acted accordingly.</p>

<p>“If the young man you are thinking of is a first-rate
<i>young</i> engineer, there will be a splendid opening
for him with us down there. Fuzzy and
Alexander and I were talking about it to-day. I
said I would like to get all the young engineers
I had met through my acquaintance with the
Brewsters to go down there and make their fortunes—as they will be able to do in such a project.
Now you might write this young man and have
him write to me to reserve any opening for him
which may come up. If he could get to California
and meet us there before Fuzzier sails, he
might prove to be a valuable man to take down
there.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Dalky! Thank you so much. Now I’ll
have <i>you</i> write to Paul and tell him exactly what
you told me. It will bear more weight, coming
from you, of course. And it will let me out of
appearing over-anxious to encourage him to make
good, see my point.”</p>

<p>Mr. Dalken laughed. “Yes, I see your point,
Nolla, and I must add that you are too particular—even
as Polly is. These young men who are so
devoted to you girls now, may change their minds
once they reach South America and find how
lovely and willing to be loved are the girls there.
You may never have Paul yearn to come back,
after having a southern beauty make love to him.”</p>

<p>“In that case, he is not worth pining for. If
a man cannot love a girl as well when he is absent
from her as he does when he is present with
her, he is not to be trusted in love,” declared
Eleanor, tossing her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but that you are right, Nolla!”
said Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“I <i>know</i> I am, Dalky. Life is long, and love
is fleeting, so it is best to find a mate who is loyal
and true in all circumstances, don’t you think so?”
said wise Eleanor.</p>

<p>“You’re a good judge, and if all girls were as
thoughtful, before they became engaged, there
would be less marital troubles,” agreed Mr. Dalken.</p>

</h2>

<p>Having concluded his business with the two
representatives of Sam White’s estate, Mr. Dalken
decided that he had earned a rest. Therefore,
when the young people asked, “Where
next?” he replied: “To Castle Hot Springs.”</p>

<p>This came as a surprise, because Jack had
planned that day that they would all go on to
Phœnix, where not only business could be attended
to by the three men in the party, but the
younger members would find every kind of sport
they might care to enjoy.</p>

<p>Dalky’s wish was law, however, and that evening
found his entire party domiciled at the high-class
hotel located at the Springs. The main feature
of interest seen from the autos on that drive
from Hot Springs Junction, where they left the
train, was the great varieties of cacti, some of
which towered as high as twenty-five feet above
the ground.</p>

<p>Hot Springs was an ideal resort for resting,
and Dalky wished he might remain there a month.
The golf and tennis, the open air swimming pools,
the delightful horseback rides to points of interest,
brought a sense of peace to the three men
who had raced here and there in Illinois, Colorado,
New Mexico and Arizona ever since they
met together at Chicago. The week spent at the
Springs did more, perhaps, to stimulate Mr. Dalken’s
keen and ever alert brain than anything he
could have done.</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney was not a devotee of swimming
in ready-made pools, but she preferred a nice, comfortable
bathtub. Therefore, she generally
watched the others swim whenever they took the
plunge. It needed no more than the first trial to
show Mr. Dalken that he might give that time to
better purposes, if he went for his swim before
breakfast in the morning. So, the second day of
the tourists’ stay at Hot Springs, found all but
Mrs. Courtney and Mr. Dalken running to the
pool about ten o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p>“Why, Dalky! Aren’t you coming in with us?”
cried Polly.</p>

<p>“I’ve taken my dip—before breakfast,” returned
he.</p>

<p>Eleanor sent Polly a knowing glance, and then
plunged from the diving board. Jack and the
three girls enjoyed the fun to the utmost, and thus
they forgot to keep an eye upon the two watchers
who usually received more than their share of
attention from the girls.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander never came near the swimming
pool, and Algy, of course, would not think of
doing anything that his patroness did not approve;
hence they were sitting on the verandah of
the hotel, vainly believing they were the center
of envious eyes, whereas the other guests then
lounging about the wide porch never thought of
the over-dressed lady and her insignificant escort.</p>

<p>Mr. Fuzzier and Mr. Alexander were splashing
and diving about in the pool, and this left Mr.
Dalken and his companion free to follow their
own inclinations. By the time the two were
missed from their recent post at the edge of the
swimming pool, it was impossible to learn what
had become of them.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter was that Mr. Dalken
invited his friend to go for an auto drive to the
Junction, where he wished to attend to some personal
shopping. And Mrs. Courtney, having
nothing better to do at the moment, accepted his
friendly invitation. The distance to the Junction
being about twenty-four miles, and the day being
balmy and beautiful, the chauffeur was advised to
drive slowly and give his passengers due opportunity
to view the wonderful country they would
pass through. Thus it took the entire morning
before the two runaways were able to reach the
hotel again, and this unaccounted for absence gave
rise to all sorts of speculations in the minds of
the girls.</p>

<p>Directly after coming from the dressing rooms
of the bath-houses, Eleanor whispered to her two
companions: “Now I know why Dalky wanted
this vacation. He was head over heels in attending
to financial matters of the utmost importance,
and suddenly, when he found that Atchison man
making up to Mrs. Courtney, he takes us all away
from the busy world and loses a week here at
the Hot Springs. He knows he will have his
chance here to carry out his plans—you know
what, girls!”</p>

<p>Polly knew, but she was not easily persuaded
that Eleanor’s interpretation was correct. “I
really believe Dalky was tired out—you must remember
that <i>we</i> had a few weeks in which to rest
after the cruise from South America, but Dalky
went right on racing about New York, holding
conferences and attending to important business
matters. From the moment we left New York
City on the Limited, he has been working ceaselessly—either
with brain or body, and that tells
on one, unless you take a rest. At the same time,
I doubt if he would have thought of resting at
this ideal resort had it not been for Mrs. Courtney.
Now it remains to be seen how near right
Nolla is.”</p>

<p>“I agree with Polly—Dalky is too matter-of-fact
to plan any romantic affair here at the
Springs. If he wants to ask some one to marry
him, I bet he’d do it right in front of us all,” said
Dodo.</p>

<p>“There you are mistaken!” exclaimed Polly
and Eleanor together. And Polly added: “Dalky
has more romance in his make-up than you give
him credit for. The only trouble is that it has
been suppressed by the unhappy conditions of his
first marriage.”</p>

<p>“You might say the same about Mrs. Courtney,
too!” declared Eleanor. “If it were not that
both of them have had such lamentable experiences,
I am sure they would have shown each
other plainly, long before this, that they were
ideally mated, and that would have ended all our
worries.”</p>

<p>Dodo laughed merrily and then added: “Nothing
to worry about, Nolla. It isn’t as though he
was your beau.”</p>

<p>“No; but can’t you see that it does matter?
If Dalky is happily married to Mrs. Courtney,
who is his other half-soul if there is such a thing,
it stands to reason that Polly and I shall always
be welcome additions to their little nest. Should
Dalky marry some woman of whom we know
nothing, what chance is there for our future welcome?”
Eleanor frowned at such a dreadful supposition,
and her two friends laughed.</p>

<p>“You may be married first, Nolla, and then
you can invite Dalky to visit you,” ventured
Dodo.</p>

<p>“No, Doe! Polly and I have sworn to see dear
Dalky happily settled first, before we may give a
thought to husbands for ourselves,” explained
Eleanor, seriously.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be queer if Dalky should confess
he was in love with Polly? He certainly likes
her more than any one else I know. If Polly became
Mrs. Dalken we would sure have a good
time with her,” laughed Dodo.</p>

<p>“Why!” gasped Polly, horrified. “You talk
like a—a—a I don’t know what!”</p>

<p>Eleanor laughed aloud. “That is sacrilege,
Dodo. Polly reveres Dalky too much to ever
dream of wasting his life by thinking of her for
a future bride.”</p>

<p>“Besides, there is Tom Latimer to be reckoned
with. If Dalky ever carried out such a plan
as I just mentioned, Tom Latimer would have
his heart—like Shylock, you know,” giggled
Dodo, enjoying Polly’s annoyance and horror.</p>

<p>“But Shylock never got that heart,” added
Eleanor. “Neither would Tom get Dalky’s—but
such things are out of the question.”</p>

<p>“I should think they were!” snapped Polly.
“You girls seem to be beau-crazy, and I have no
patience with you—not a bit.” So saying, she
walked quickly away by herself.</p>

<p>When the three girls met again it was at
luncheon time. Mr. Dalken and Mrs. Courtney
were ascending the front steps of the wide verandah,
but there were no tell-tale expressions upon
the faces of either one. Eleanor searched in vain
for the blush that might inform her whether Mrs.
Courtney planned to become Mrs. Dalken.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander learned that Mrs. Courtney
had accompanied the young folks to the swimming
pool every morning, and she immediately conjectured
that she did this in order to wear a fetching
gown and carry her white wrap—white was
<i>so</i> becoming to elderly women!</p>

<p>Then she heard that Mr. Dalken had escorted
her there, and Mr. Fuzzier had come up out of
the water to sit upon the bank and talk with her.
This was enough incentive for her to plan how
she would take Algy, and walk to the pool in the
morning, and show off her lovely white serge
gown and suede shoes. She had a flapper-stick
which she had used at Colorado Springs, fondly
believing herself the envy of all the women.
This she would carry the following morning.</p>

<p>She knew better than to breathe a word of her
plan to any one else, but directly after breakfast
the next morning, she went to her room and began
to dress for the parade she had decided upon.</p>

<p>Algy had been commanded to sit and wait for
his patroness, and he obeyed just as any good little
poodle would do. He sat slowly rocking in a
huge, reed, porch chair, vacantly staring at a
great stucco pillar of the pergola. Not that there
was aught to see upon the pillar, but it served to
interest his mind as well as anything.</p>

<p>The group of swimmers left the hotel to go to
the bathhouses, and soon after this Mrs. Alexander
came out of her room, dressed as she had
planned the previous evening. She carried her
imported flapper-stick, and she also carried a most
artistic basket which contained some wool and a
partly knitted scarf. She knew nothing about a
knitting needle, but the basket was a beautiful
Indian specimen recently purchased by Dodo at
Grand Canyon, and Dodo’s knitting might lead
guests to believe that the lady carrying the work
was accomplished in the art. Other ladies sitting
upon the verandah during morning hours had
compared their knitting and embroidery, and
Mrs. Alexander understood it was quite the
proper thing to do.</p>

<p>Algy hopped up the moment he saw Mrs. Alexander
approach, and she, in order to be impressive
before the group of ladies busily at work
upon their handicraft, handed him the basket with
the admonition:</p>

<p>“Do be careful, Algy, of the ball of wool. If
it falls out it may ravel all my knitting, you
know. And that stitch is a very intricate one
to do.”</p>

<p>Algy took the basket as though it were some
sacred relic, and, as he toddled after Mrs. Alexander,
he caused smiles upon the faces of the
ladies watching the little scene. After the two
had gone down the foot-path, those upon the
verandah left little unsaid about the vanity of the
lady and the vacuity of the young man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander felt sure she had caused a feeling
of envy in the hearts of every woman upon
that verandah, and this certainty made her feel
satisfied with herself. As she reached the pool
where an iron hand-rail protects watchers from
falling into the water, she smiled to herself, thinking
how much better she looked in comparison
with Mrs. Courtney, who stood upon the platform
with Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander had just scrambled out of the
pool and now was mounting to the platform,
when Mr. Fuzzier, at his heels, spoke to him.
“Your wife is standing over there watching you,
Alex.”</p>

<p>“Umph! There’s safety in distance!” grunted
Mr. Alexander.</p>

<div id='004' class='mt10 mb10 w004'>
  <img src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
  <p class='caption'>“OUCH! OUCH!” SCREAMED ALGY.</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Alexander saw that the three men seemed
to be devoting their attention to Mrs. Courtney,
and this was not as it should be, thought she.
Hence she turned to Algy, and said:
“I am going over to join my husband, Algy,”
and she nodded in the direction of the group
upon the diving-platform.</p>

<p>Algy followed as usual, carrying the ornamental
basket upon his arm. In walking too near
Mrs. Alexander, however, he inadvertently
stubbed his toe and stumbled. To steady himself
he caught at her arm, and unconsciously dropped
the basket.</p>

<p>Having righted himself once more, he stooped
and picked up the basket, but he failed to notice
that the ball of worsted rolled out and remained
caught under a tuft of grass beside the walk.
When he started again for the platform, the ball
began to unroll its length of wool, and the scarf
also began to respond to the tugging at it as it
remained in the basket, and the stitches gradually
ravelled out. By the time Algy joined those
standing upon the platform, half of Dodo’s pretty
scarf had diminished into its original strand of
wool.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander swung her handsome cane aimlessly
to and fro to attract Mrs. Courtney’s attention,
since that was the only reason for her
carrying it, but her husband also saw it.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horned Spoon, Maggie!
How’d you ever come to fetch a walkin’ stick?
Folks will think you are locoed.”</p>

<p>But his wife paid no heed to his remark—he
was too ignorant of the ways of fashionable society
to cause her any concern. She turned to
prattle to Mrs. Courtney about the jealousy of
the women upon the hotel verandah—“They are
so envious of one who has better clothes, you
know, that I really had to leave them. Did you
ever see such dowdies as they are?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Courtney had not noticed, and she admitted
it. At the same time she had to control
a desire to tell Mrs. Alexander how unsuitably
<i>she</i> was dressed for a simple morning recreation
hour. Perhaps Mr. Alexander would have
spoken for her, had not Algy diverted all attention
to himself.</p>

<p>Jack had been watching the slow progress of
Algy and his companion from the pathway to the
platform, and he planned, when he saw the young
man so near the water, that he would swim close
to the side and begin to splash, so that the water
would sprinkle him.</p>

<p>Algy had been intent upon the conversation between
the two ladies, and now, when he felt the
drops of water falling upon him, he looked aloft,
thinking a sprinkler or shower must be leaking
upon him. Seeing nothing overhead, he glanced
down and saw some one kicking and sending up
great showers of water. Algy felt that it was
his duty to speak to this thoughtless swimmer, and
to warn him that well-groomed persons upon the
platform would be made uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Heah, you! I say! Don’t cha see what
youah ah doing? My white flannels are all spotted,
and the ladies——” At this moment Algy’s
foot slid upon the wet, slippery plank, and in another
second he had made a head dive—basket
and wool, and all!</p>

<p>Since he detested water in quantity sufficient
for swimming, Algy was unprepared for his impromptu
bath. It was quite deep beneath the
platform, to accommodate those who wished to
dive, and now the frightened youth came to the
surface spluttering and throwing hands above his
head in a wild attempt to clutch at some support.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alexander received the first genuine shock
in many moons, and she acted like the old-time
Maggie whom Mr. Alexander remembered with
regret. “My goodness, Ebeneezer!” cried she,
forgetting the expensive cane in her fear for
Algy’s life, and using it to hold down for him to
hold to. “Jump in and save him quick!”</p>

<p>“That ain’t the ocean, Maggie,” retorted her
husband. “A little warm water won’t hurt his
head.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you cruel man. Won’t some one save the
boy?” pleaded she.</p>

<p>“Jack!” shouted Mr. Dalken, “swim up and
give him help to climb up on the steps.”</p>

<p>Jack had been hovering near enough to Algy
to grip him when he had been sufficiently tested,
and now he reached out and grabbed him by the
coat collar and propelled him over to the steep
steps which led up from the pool.</p>

<p>“There you are, my son,” laughed Jack, as he
tried to show Algy how he was to hold fast to the
handrail.</p>

<p>But the frightened young man appeared to
have lost all sense, for he merely hung limp from
Jack’s grasp. After a short time of having to
hold up his weight, Jack got tired, and said:
“I’m going to drop him if he won’t help himself.
I can’t carry him out as though he had been
drowned, Dalky!”</p>

<p>The word “drowned” seemed to rouse the dormant
brain in Algy, and he frantically caught hold
of anything within reach. Fortunately it happened
to be the steps, and soon he had his feet
upon them. Then Jack boosted from behind,
while Mrs. Alexander caught hold of his hair
and pulled from above.</p>

<p>“Ouch! Ouch!” screamed Algy, but he feared
to let go his grasp on the ladder in order to make
the hand clutching his long blonde hair release its
hold.</p>

<p>Thus he came up over the top of the platform,
a dripping, drowned-looking, lank young man, the
tears streaming from his eyes, and the water
streaming from every wrinkle in his sopping
clothes. He presented such a pathetic yet comic
picture that his friends wavered between a desire
to laugh and a desire to sympathize. Eventually
both were indulged, but Algy paid no heed to
either.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” wailed he, shivering as he
sent a glance of terror at the pool.</p>

<p>“Go right into the bath-house and ask the attendant
to give you a rub-down and dry your
clothes,” advised Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>But Algy seemed to have had his last bit of
sense washed out of him, and he stood shivering
without making a move to do as he had been advised. Then Mr. Alexander took a hand in the
case.</p>

<p>“Come along there, A. A. A.! If you don’t
get off this wet platform, you’ll slip back in the
pool again. Now come on!”</p>

<p>As though the threat of more water roused him
from sleep, Algy hurried after Mr. Alexander.
Then it was seen that he still clutched the Indian
basket; and the strand of wool, having so entangled
itself through the dive and the rescue,
stretched and stretched, and at last it snapped!
When Mrs. Alexander saved her daughter’s
work-basket, still dangling from Algy’s hand, the
scarf had been unravelled, and but one row of
stitches remained upon the needles in the basket.</p>

<p>“Why, Ma! Isn’t that my work-basket which
A. A. A. has upon his arm?” exclaimed Dodo,
astonishment uppermost in her expression.</p>

<p>“I think it is, Dodo. I used it for my work,
this morning, but I did not remove your knitting.”</p>

<p>“Your work! What work was that, Ma?”
asked Dodo, in amazement.</p>

<p>“Oh! A bit of work that I wanted to do this
morning. Something of which you know nothing.
I fear it is gone now—in the pool, likely,” and
Mrs. Alexander sighed with regret.</p>

</h2>

<p>Mr. Dalken must have made important headway
in his plans of engaging Mrs. Courtney’s
heart during the short vacation at Hot Springs,
because Polly and Eleanor noticed thereafter how
they managed to secure tête-à-têtes and exchange
quiet though understanding glances when they believed
themselves unseen. It would have been
difficult, however, to escape the watchful eyes of
Polly and Eleanor, because this romance was exactly
what they had hoped to perfect during the
past two years.</p>

<p>The trip from Hot Springs to Phœnix was not
very long, but quite long enough to give Mr. Dalken
an opportunity to sit beside Mrs. Courtney
and engage her entire attention with what he had
to say. It seems he had need of papers and plans
in this conversation, and Polly gladly believed he
was explaining about his interests, in order to
prove to Mrs. Courtney that she would not be
making a mistake by trusting her future to his
wisdom and care.</p>

<p>The Salt River Valley, which covers an area as
large as the combined states of Connecticut,
Delaware and Rhode Island, was one of great
loveliness. During the ride to Phœnix, Mr. Fuzzier
explained various sights to the girls.</p>

<p>“This great natural gorge of the Salt River
has been utilized by the United States to provide
the largest irrigating system in the world. When
we motor from Phœnix, we will stop at Roosevelt
Dam, where the waters are reserved in a vast
lake named after the famous American, Roosevelt.
The dam is 1,125 feet wide, and the curved
wall at its base is about 168 feet thick—just think
of that! The height of this tremendous dam is
284 feet, but there are wide spillways to carry off
flood-water. We will motor out there and show
you this wonder of modern engineering.” After
that the girls looked with renewed interest at the
Salt River which flows by Phœnix.</p>

<p>There were many sights to see in Phœnix and
the country round about. The girls found shopping
in the up-to-date stores a pleasure, and their
wardrobe was replenished without delay. They
visited the capitol, which was a handsome edifice;
and the time they rode to Camelback Mountain
they spent a night at Ingleside Inn.</p>

<p>But the most enjoyable trip of all those about
Phœnix, was the one to Roosevelt Lake and the
Dam. They motored there, as Mr. Fuzzier had
promised them, and the sight of the huge project
so successfully built and operated, caused even
the foolish Mrs. Alexander and the vapid Algy
to stare in silence at man’s ingenuity and capabilities.</p>

<p>“When one sees what is possible to mere man,
it enthuses one with great ideas. No wonder you
are so keen over Mr. Fuzzier’s plans to develop
the interior of Colombia, Mr. Dalken,” said Mrs.
Courtney, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“Look at this tremendous work, which had to
form first in the mind of man, and then be constructed
stone by stone, and by means of the
hands which had to obey the mandates of man’s
brain. Without the power to think correctly,
where would this completed wonder be?” remarked
Mr. Dalken, seriously.</p>

<p>That man-made wonder impressed the girls
and Jack more than the natural wonders found
in the great southwest, and all the way back to
Phœnix, they were discussing the power to think.</p>

<p>Another trip made while making Phœnix their
headquarters, was the outing to Hotel San
Marcos. Here the entire party enjoyed the recreations
and social life which is possible through
the exclusiveness of the hotel and its cottages.</p>

<p>During the time which Mr. Dalken and his two
associates had to devote to interviews and business
conferences with men of affairs in Phœnix,
the girls and Jack enjoyed tennis and golf at the
Country Club; cards of introduction for them had
been presented by a bank president, who was
deeply interested in the South American plan of
development.</p>

<p>Finally Mr. Dalken announced that he had finished
his business in Arizona and was ready to
go on to California.</p>

<p>“At last!” sighed Polly, for whom this entire
trip meant a visit to the Golden Gate State.</p>

<p>“To hear you, one might think you expected to
meet your fate in California,” laughed Jack, as
the train started for Cadiz, where they would continue
on the Santa Fé lines to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>“Maybe she will—Tom Latimer will meet us
there,” announced Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“No! Really?” cried Eleanor, anxiously
watching Mr. Dalken’s face to learn if any one
else might be expected to meet them in California.</p>

<p>“Yes, Tom writes he will be on hand shortly
after we arrive. And I also heard from a few
other young engineers to whom I extended an invitation
to join Mr. Fuzzier’s party to South
America. I have received acceptances from several
of these. I wonder if you girls will care to
meet Paul Stewart—Anne’s brother, you know?
I haven’t seen him since he visited my apartment
that winter, and was the cause of Jack’s jealous
feud.”</p>

<p>Jack and Polly laughed at the remembrance,
but Eleanor eagerly exclaimed: “Well, what
about him?”</p>

<p>“Why, he is going with Fuzzy, to show what is
in him. I, personally, believe he will turn out to
be one of our most valuable young men down
there. Anyway, he will have the chance of his
life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, goody! goody!” cried Eleanor, clapping
her hands excitedly.</p>

<p>Her friends smiled in sympathy, because they
surmised, though Eleanor never confided to any
one, that she was more than interested in Paul’s
success for his <i>own</i> future.</p>

<p>“Yes, Nolla, and that happy-go-lucky brother
of yours—Pete Maynard, is joining this group
of engineers, too. That ought to make Dodo
happy, since she always thought he needed something
besides money to bring out the mettle he has
in him,” added Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>This was a genuine surprise to the others, because
no one knew that Dodo was acquainted with
Pete Maynard. Dodo flushed and stammered:
“I met Pete the time Ma stopped in Chicago to
enjoy society there. Pete and I found a lot in
common to talk of—you girls, and the college
friends we all know, with whom he went through
the engineering class.”</p>

<p>“Was that all you two had in common?”
laughed Eleanor.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we are both democratic, you know,
and Pete is not as attached to mere money as you
all think he is. Anyway, Ma didn’t approve of
him, until she heard he was a Maynard of <i>the</i>
Maynards of Chicago—a password to society, I’ll
have you know, Nolla.”</p>

<p>“Don’t I know it, only too well! My mother
and your Ma should have been bosom friends,
Dodo, because they think alike about so many
things. But, tell me; why did Pete never write
me about knowing you, Doe?”</p>

<p>“How can I answer that question? You must
ask him when you reach California,” laughed
Dodo.</p>

<p>“There are so many important things waiting
for us to do in California, I can hardly wait to
get there,” declared Polly.</p>

<p>The scenery across country from Phœnix
to Barstow, where the railroad branched for the
two important points in California—San Francisco
being one terminus and Los Angeles the
other—was wonderful, and there was not much
inclination to talk of other things. The ride over
the Mojave Desert seemed to take the tourists
from the New World and drop them upon the
Sahara, or the great tractless deserts of the East.</p>

<p>Having turned to the southern terminus, the
train flew past great orange groves, where, in
places, the girls could have plucked the fruit by
stretching forth a hand from the windows. The
fine palm trees also grew close to the railway
tracks, and the magnificent flowers and ferns almost
screened the train at places.</p>

<p>“My! It is just what I pictured it,” sighed
Polly, with fervor. And her friends agreed silently
with her opinion.</p>

<p>There is no time in which to describe all the
joys of that arrival in California. Between days
spent in continual pleasure-seeking, and going
sight-seeing to one place and another, the weeks
passed away. During the most of the time spent
in Los Angeles, Mr. Dalken and his two associates
were deeply immersed in their business projects.
Only in the evenings and on Sundays did
they take time to enjoy the society of the girls and
the ladies.</p>

<p>But the plan for the development was succeeding
far beyond Mr. Dalken’s hopes, and the three
men were greatly elated at the promises the future
held for them. Mrs. Courtney felt a corresponding
glad relief, but Polly and Eleanor
thought this was due to her interest in Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>Quite unexpectedly Mr. Dalken announced to
his friends, one night, that it would be necessary
to go to San Diego for a time—a week, or more.
This was welcome news, because all wished to go
there for a visit, yet no one had felt it right to
suggest it, because the plan might interfere with
the business plans of the men.</p>

<p>“We find there are a number of realty men in
San Diego who will be greatly interested in our
proposition. Seeing that the farther south we go
in California, the nearer the scene of our future
development we are, it stands to reason that investors
in Southern California are more readily
convinced of our ultimate success. They will be
enabled to open up better and larger fields of commerce
between these ports and those of Colombia,
and having a great and powerful organization
to back up the South American development,
makes the new project secure for investment. So
San Diego will be our next stopping place,” explained
Mr. Dalken.</p>

<p>“And you really feel certain now, Mr. Dalken,
that we have no further cause to worry over the
result of this tremendous speculation?” asked
Mrs. Courtney, with an expression of relief.</p>

<p>Polly and Eleanor exchanged glances, for they
were sure that she was glad poor, dear Dalky
would be relieved of the strain of making good,
but they were speedily destined to be surprised.</p>

<p>“Quite contrary to failure, dear Mrs. Courtney.
You have every promise of clearing thirty
per cent this very moment, on all the money you
invested with us. Should you care to sell out
your own stock to-night, you would clear up a hundred
thousand dollars. Even my scatter-brained
valet, lounging over there, did a clever thing when
he disobeyed my advice and got Fuzzier to invest
most of his capital in this company. As for the
Latimers and Brewsters, Mr. Maynard, the Ashbys,
Evans, Fabians, and all along the line of our
tried and trusting friends, I am thankful to be
able to announce that their faith is not misplaced.
But it made it doubly hard upon me, when I
learned how every one of them insisted upon risking
their money upon Fuzzier’s and my ‘high-flier,’
because I felt that it would never do to lose
an opportunity to turn a trick. Had I failed, I
am sure I would have blown myself to bits—to
avoid facing my friends. Thanks to Mrs. Courtney’s
extensive list of acquaintances throughout
the western resorts where we stopped, and Fuzzier’s
list of financial magnates, to say nothing
of my friends, and Alexander’s associates, in land
and mine deals, we now have interested the most
important, as well as the most intelligent representatives
along the line from Chicago to California.
By the time the boys arrive in Los Angeles,
we will be back from San Diego, and all
will be staged for one great send-off to the travelers
bound for Colombia.”</p>

<p>Thus Polly and Eleanor heard with amazement
the cause of the confidential chats between
Mrs. Courtney and their adored Dalky, and it is
doubtful whether they would not have preferred
to see the “great plan” go to smash if by that
means they might have heard an engagement announced
between their pet friends.</p>

<p>The visit to San Diego fulfilled its promise—not
alone to the financiers, but to the sight-seers
as well. Ten days given to outdoor sports at San
Diego and touring to every possible point of interest
in or about the city, proved to be quite
enough for the girls.</p>

<p>Upon reaching Los Angeles once more, where
they were to await the young engineers, the girls
admitted that they were almost ready to retire to
a sanatorium to recuperate from such an extended
tour.</p>

<p>“There’s only one more city for us to clean up,
girls,” was Mr. Dalken’s encouraging reply.
“When we get to San Francisco you will have
two months to do the town, and I shall have ample
time in which to use the magnet of our company
upon the rich investors to be found there.
Fuzzy and Alex. will be in the land of magnificent
ideals before then, and their reports will help sell
our remaining stock. What an unusual and wonderful
thing it would be if we were to announce a
paid-up capitalization for all our shares of stock
before we began operations down in South America!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps your success is due to the implicit
faith and respect your friends place in you and
Mr. Fuzzier and Mr. Alexander,” remarked
Mrs. Courtney, with an admiring glance at Mr.
Dalken.</p>

<p>“We thank you, fair lady, for your opinion,”
returned he.</p>

<p>At this moment a bell-boy paged Mr. Dalken,
and he beckoned him to approach. It proved to
be a telegram from Denver. Having permission
to do so, he opened it at once, and then read
aloud. “Pete, Paul and self leaving here for Los
Angeles on night express. Tom Latimer.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” cried several voices in chorus. Jack
grinned, then he remarked teasingly: “I bet Polly
and Nolla and Dodo will break their necks trying
to get those newcomers to propose to them before
they sail for South America. Poor girls—this
tour must have been awful with no one to admire
them or make love to while away the dreary
days we’ve had!”</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
